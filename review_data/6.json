The service is not unbearingly slow- dont worry . Love how they treat you as guests instead of people just dining there. They actually care :D Food is really cheap for the quality and quantity you get. \n\nMy go to is the mushroom appetizers and the cevapi or the combo [for when I feel like I can eat a horse].

Wish they were closer to me T^T\n\nThe mushrooms tbh aren't that SPECIAL. I mean I feel most of their food is very...home-y. But for some reason I always get it. It essentially is mushrooms with sour cream [of the sort] , some cheese, and on a bed of rice with a little more cheese. It tastes rly yummy with the cevapi imo. Bestie agrees. lol. The mushrooms may not be shazamm worthy, but I think the cevapis are :) Pretty much just mini sausages that aren't dried out and have a nice little char on them [not burnt]. Srsly love how flavorful it is , and the deliciously chewy , hot bun it comes in (not sure if it is lepinja or burek?)..with the crunchiness of raw onions. epic. A simple but delicious meal. Can't say enough. \n\nAnyways I ordered 2 cevapis ($10 each) and a mushroom ($10) to go today and they said it would be ready in 15 so I said ok why not. When I got there, I guess they were getting increasingly busy so it ended up being ready in 20, not that big of a deal. The person manning the front today [usually is a lady] was suppper nice.

We had to walk by frat houses. The walk wasn't too bad. \n\nENVIRONMENT: It is located in a small looking house. We almost missed it because it looked like a normal house! The only thing that gave it away was the very small parking lot. We didn't have parking problems because we parked at Santa Clara University. Inside Euro Grill, it was very small and very limited seating. The cash register is literally right next to the door. There is VERY LIMITED SEATING. Make sure to make a reservation if you are coming in a group bigger than 2. It was only me and my boyfriend and we made a reservation anyways. We got a big table for 4 because all the other small tables were taken. IT WAS CROWDED.\n\nFOOD: The thing that sucked about this place was that a lot of the food we wanted to try was already out. For example, the Burek, Cavapi, Goulash, Gyro sandwich, and so much more was out. We came on a Saturday night around 6PM. The waitress said those are the first to go out apparently. :( I was sad because I was really excited to try them. We got Palacinke crepe filled with nutella for dessert and it was really good.

There was only one waitress out there. She was literally being the cash register person and the waitress serving for 15 people at the same time. It was too crazy for her. We got seated immediately but it took a while before she came to give us the menu.

It comes served next to these semi mashed potatoes. The potatoes hav a dallop o sour cream that really helps the flavor at least for me. It also comes with this big roll/slab o bread that kinda reminds me o sourdough cept way fluffier.... The bread is really good as its soft and it soaks up the soup really well. The dish goes really well together. Id dip the bread in the stew with the potatoes and get it all kinda together to get this beef stew mashed potato w/ sour cream sandwich concoction.

I've been here twice and it seems that it is getting worse and worse. I love \u010cevap\u010di\u010di (small sausages) and Pleskavice (patties) and Burek (puff pastry with meat, or Sirnica with cheese). Those were my main reasons for doing this 40 mile drive. But, not anymore. I'm really disappointed. Their menu is growing shorter and shorter and I have no idea why. Is it the lack of people who'd know how to make this type of food, or is it too much fuss for the owners and they just stopped doing certain foods?\n\nThe first time we got here I wanted to order Burek and \u010cevap\u010di\u010di. They didn't have Burek, so I had a portion of \u010cevap\u010di\u010di and was satisfied. They didn't have Kajmak (type of cheese) to go with the meat (you'll get it in any place that makes \u010cevap\u010di\u010di in Europe and it's not hard to make at home), but I thought okay, maybe they ran out, so I had Ajvar instead (Yogurt/Sour Cream only goes well with Burek, not with \u010cevpa\u010di\u010di in my opinion). Meat was well prepared and tasty, so was the Lepinja bread that comes with it. No complaints there. \n\nSide note: People are complaining about the food being very salty... it's actually normal. If you're gonna try these foods in the Balkans (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia,...), you'll have the same problem. It's just old school, that's how they're made, with a lot of salt. It's bad for you, yes, but nations down there grew up with that. Authentic as you might call it.\n\nOk, next. We came the second time. This time I really wanted to have Burek, but the owner said they don't have it. Again! Seriously?! They didn't run out, they simply don't have it. Then why does the menu say you have it, if you don't? Not to mention they stopped serving fries, Goulash and Sarme (cabbage rolls). I was told a few weeks later that they've changed the menu now, so they don't offer these things anymore. At least that. But it's too bad, cause Burek is just a part of their cuisine and it's such a shame they removed it from the menu.\n\nI really am disappointed. I know they probably have their regular clientele that comes and orders same things over and over, and that's fine, but they used to offer so much more and just stopped. You can still get certain items (frozen) next door in their store (Euro Shop), but it's not the same. Burek made from scratch is better than any frozen one.\n\nI don't think we're gonna give them a third try. It is a too long of a ride to come for something they obviously stopped making ages ago.

HOWEVER, the reason why Euro Grill gets bumped down to a measly 3 stars is because of their inconsistent hours!  Maybe it's just me hopping on the extra large strugglebus, but I can never figure out when they're open!\n\nBefore all you happy campers get all upset at me, LEMME EXPLAIN YO.  Initially when I came here, I loved it!  In fact, I loved it so much that I was determined to share it with my super foodie friend who loves Mediterranean/Greek food.  We have now tried to come here THREE different times and each time, Euro Grill was CLOSED.  I don't understand!  It's so frustrating!  We've come during their supposedly posted \"open\" hours and they just aren't open!  They lie!  Or it's a freaking conspiracy .. haven't decided yet.\n\nNevertheless, I would recommend trying the place.  It's a little difficult to get to and might involve some circling, but do attempt to try it.  And get the gyro.  Their bread is a scrumptious, light, soft masterpiece that makes my mouth water.

Bread alone rates much higher.", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 2}, {"index": 268, "review": "This place was so AWESOME! So glad we stopped on our way home. We were greated with open arms and reminded me of growing up in old Yugoslavia! This will always be our last stop on our way home. Great food, service, and great people.", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 5}, {"index": 269, "review": "Service was excellent. My wife and I arrived around 12:00 on a Sunday and were greeted by a gentlemen who told  us we could sit where ever we wanted but recommended us to his favorite spot in the restaurant.  After being seated the waiter went to the kitchen and then returned with a pastry he suggested we try.  My wife and I both sampled the pastry which was delicious.  We were given this sample free of charge and it was a good size portion.  For lunch we each had the gyros and fries both of which were amazing.  The gyro was enormous and came on a homemade bread that was a welcome change to your typical pita bread.  The fries here were also great, perfectly golden and crispy.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  It was small and intimate but not crowded or cluttered. \n\nI will return here to try other items on their menu.", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 5}, {"index": 270, "review": "Had lunch here today for the first time and look forward to coming back. I had the gyro, wife had the spicy sausage sandwich. Both came on delicious home made bread, a welcome change to the usual pita. The gyro was excellent, seasoned to perfection. The sausage sandwich had a little kick, but not super hot. It was served with a red pepper spread and a dollop of sour cream. We were both happily stuffed.

The guy that took our orders was pretty funny too, but he had trouble explaining what the food was. I had the combination dish and it was awesome and filling, I am pretty sure he told me that he was going to give me extra.

A bosnian friend recommended this place so I checked it out.  I've been there twice and had a good experience both times.  Both times I had the Cevapi, it's kind of like a burger and really good.  Instead of a meat patty they use sausages and the bread used for the bun is unique, it's freshly made there.  It's served with a tomato sauce and sour cream.  What I liked was all the ingredients were very familiar but tasted slightly different.  I was told by some other people dining there that Cevapi is very popular in all the balkan countries.  They also said to try the Sarma, cabbage stuffed with meat.  Service is a bit slow so don't go there when you are in a hurry.  It's a great chance to try something new.", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 4}, {"index": 273, "review": "The friendly owners of Euro Market (http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-market-santa-clara / www.euromarketsantaclara.com) have added an adjoining restaurant as promised.

One stop place if you are really hungry.", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 5}, {"index": 276, "review": "After coming back from a trip through Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia, I can say that this restaurant definitely helped me ease back into life in America. The pljeskavica is really tasty and the cevapi is very nice as well- though it tastes a bit different from what I had back in the Balkans. I don't know what bread they used, it doesn't taste quite like Somun, but it was still really good. Sarma was tasty, recommended for a non-adventurous eater.. can't go wrong with a cabbage roll. Prices are good and very happy to find that they indeed serve Tufahija. Burek is perfect and not too greasy. Try a Cockta with your meal for a nice Balkan soda. Only thing missing is that they don't have kajmak and used sour cream instead. Otherwise, great restaurant, very nice staff, and good prices. Highly recommended. Also, check out the grocery market next door for some Balkan goodies and foods.. Milka bars, Cedevita, Vegeta.. just to name a few.", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 5}, {"index": 277, "review": "I'm not going to repeat others' accolades - but this place is totally worth trying out.

Tried the goulash with rice and came with a side of sour cream. The goulash had meats and veggies in a light tomato sauce. I couldn't stop eating it. Had the whole thing and was stuffed. Unfortunately I would never have found this place on my own. Its not very noticeable and the parking lot is in the back. We literally drove right passed it while looking for it and totally missed it. The bread was homemade and fresh. Though it is a tiny restaurant. Also tried their sausage and it was just ok for me.

We wanted to try it as it had recently opened.  The owner couldn't have been more friendly and helpful in explaining the menu items.  The food was excellent! And more than filling!  Prices are extremely reasonable  and the service was good (thought there weren't many other customers).  It is a very small restaurant, entered from the parking lot.  I would like  to see a little more variety on the menu but the sausages are so good that I guess it doesn't matter as I would probably order them anyway!", "name": "Euro Grill", "rating": 4}]
