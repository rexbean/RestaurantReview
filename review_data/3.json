The pickles served on the side were a nice addition.\n\n2) Takoyaki - Nice crisp exterior and the octopus on the inside was cooked just right where it had enough of a chew/bounce back factor.

The sauce was tasty but since the chicken was already pre-soaked in it, the crunch of the chicken was a little lacking and left to be desired for.

THERE IS A SMALL PUBLIC LOT RIGHT BEHIND THE RESTAURANT...what!? \n\nWith that taken care of, we walked into the restaurant and were seated immediately. I absolute love Japanese hospitality and Ramen Taka had that in spades. The waiters and waitresses greeted us with the friendliest of smiles, immediately gave us some ice cold waters before we were even fully seated, personally handed each of us a menu, and came by to take our orders speedily. The one part that suffered was the length of time it took for food to come out, especially when our appetizer was served simultaneously with our entrees. Perhaps the cooks were a bit understaffed because a lot of tables had the same problem.\n\nHowever, the quality of the food totally made up for it. To share, my parents and I chose the spicy karaage and for ramen, my mother chose the chashu ramen, my father the miso ramen, and I the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. The small size was plenty enough for us; in fact, we practically had to force ourselves to finish everything because we were getting so full. Strangely enough, the star of the show wasn't the ramen. It was that tender, juicy, and clear-your-sinuses spicy karaage. My parents were undeniably impressed with that, so impressed that they even contemplated ordering another serving. The batter was perfectly crispy without all that grease and the chicken fell apart with ease. What a great start!\n\nAs for the ramen, my mom really enjoyed the chashu pork and noted that the broth wasn't salty, allowing her to slurp up quite a number of spoonfuls. My father's miso broth did veer towards the salty side, but he liked the slight bite in the ramen noodles and the heat as well. As for me, I absolutely loved my tonkotsu. The broth was creamy and simple without all the heavy salt. The noodles were cooked to \"al-dente\" perfection and the chashu was melt-in-your-mouth good. The egg, however, was just a TEENSY bit overcooked, so it didn't ooze as much as I would have liked.\n\nPrices are incredibly reasonable for both the quality and the portions.

You're in a rush and aren't willing to wait a long time for an experience? I've got the most perfect place for you: Ramen Taka.\n\nWhen my girlfriend and I started dating, we made it our hobby to explore all the \"good\" ramen places in the Bay Area and uncover the creme de la creme of Japanese noodles. The great thing about the wonderful Bay (THE BAE) is that Japanese Ramen shops are in an abundance. For example, in San Francisco there are definitely more places than you can count on your fingers (ranging from places like Mensho to Izakaya Sozai). And in the San Jose/Silicon Valley region where I live, there's legendary favorites such as Santouka in the Mitsuwa Marketplace and Orenchi on Homestead. \n\nRecently, we wanted to try our hand at a new place nearby. One quick Yelp search brought us to Ramen Taka, a little shop near Santa Clara University. A lot of people compared Ramen Taka to Orenchi and one person even went as far as to say that their \"Karage is the best.\" That's all we needed to read into before deciding to visit this hot spot. \n\nRamen Taka is located on The Alameda in Santa Clara (where El Camino pretty much ends). It's situated directly next to Santa Clara U, so it's VERY accessible for students. Parking can be pretty horrible (especially during school year) since a lot of spots on the street are reserved for residents. But hopefully you can find a spot. We came around 630pm on a Thursday during the summer and were able to get a spot after circling around once. I do recommend coming in early because of poor parking.\n\nThe first thing that really caught my attention at Ramen Taka was that the environment was PERFECT for casual Japanese dining. For example, all the employees inside were SUPER friendly. Right when we walked in, we were greeted politely and were seated right away. Even though the shop is super small, there's decorations everywhere that make the interior very cozy. I love the fact that there are random lights hung up, as well as pictures + specials hanging on the wall. If you are wondering whether this place may get crowded (due to the small size of the shop), there's actually plenty of seating! This is SUCH a welcome change from places like Orenchi where you may have to wait HELLA LONG for good ramen. Good food should be enjoyed without needless waiting, and you won't have to worry about that here.\n\nIn terms of the menu, Ramen Taka's list of items is SUPER simple; this place literally just has several choices for ramen and LOADS of options for appetizers (they also have a lunch special). For ramen, they have their special Taka Ramen, which is essentially a pork-based broth with your usual egg, green onions, spork, and wood ears. The COOL thing is that this place uses special \"thin noodles.\" I actually recommend this because it's a change! They also have a Chasu Ramen, which is the Taka + 4 more slices of pork. If you aren't interested, they also have Shio, Tonkatus, and Miso Ramen. NOTE: there's no ramen challenge here. Sorry guys. In terms of appetizers, they have it all!!! They have everything from karage to potato salad! We ended up getting two normal Taka Ramens + a spicy Karage. Here's what we thought...\n\n-Spicy Karage (8/10). Coming into Ramen Taka, I had pretty high standards for Karage. My favorite place for Japanese battered chicken will always be Geta's Karage, but I had high hopes for this place (given the hype). And overall, I wasn't disappointed. You get 6 large pieces of chicken for $8. Each one is SUPER juicy and flavorful. It wasn't really that spicy, but I loved the added heat. They give you some lettuce with it + a dip as well. The only downside was that it could've been crispier. Was this the best? NOPE, but worth an order for the price!\n\n-Ramen Taka (10/10). For the price (only $9), I don't think there's any other restaurant that even COMES CLOSE to Ramen Taka. First, the broth was SUPER flavorful. I sipped that soup like nothing (wasn't too salty nor too heavy). The thin noodles were a nice change, the eggs were very soft, and the meat was extremely juicy. I thought the portion size was really good too! If I were to compare this ramen straight up to the best in the area without considering price (i.e. against Orenchi and Santouka), I'd say Ramen Taka ranks just slightly below the two. But man, for $9, Ramen Taka is appealing.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend Ramen Taka. It's deserving of an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this.\" I don't think I've ever 1. paid so little for such good ramen + karage and 2. never even had to wait. And oh yea, did I mention that the SERVICE IS AMAZING HERE? I really recommend coming out. Whether just for the ramen, or the appetizers, or the welcoming atmosphere.

I did love that it came with one whole soft-boiled egg , cooked to perfection AND I did thoroughly enjoy the amount of meat there was. Now, the chasu bowl was also delicious. A mini bowl is just the right amount in addition to the ramen for someone with a good appetite as I was pretty full after finishing everything. \n\nOverall, I was pretty satisfied with my meal and may come back if I'm around the area to try their other ramen bowls!", "name": "Ramen Taka", "rating": 4}, {"index": 36, "review": "I was very impressed with Ramen Taka.

With 4 parties in front of us, I wasn't sure how long the wait would be but it was pretty fast! \n\nAfter being seated, we decided on their Kaki Fry (fried oysters) appetizer and two orders of their Taka Ramen since that seemed to be their most popular item + a lunch special. The lunch special consisted of your choice of ramen paired with either a mini chashu bowl or mini fried rice and small salad. All of this was $13! Such a great deal! \n\nThe Kaki Fry was nice and juicy, I enjoyed the crispy batter and tartar sauce that came with it. It instantly reminded me of Kotetsu's fried oysters. As for our Taka Ramen, it was so delicious!! The broth was rich and flavorful and the slices of pork were just so tender and heavenly. I was a little skeptical at first about their thin noodles since I'm used to the thick noodles that are more chewy but to my surprise I loved it! I think I might even like these noodles more... For $9 a bowl, I don't think you can beat this. The wait was fast, food was spectacular, and they were really efficient here! I noticed that a lot of tables were in and out super quick. \n\nThe side salad was yummy, I know it's just a salad but I think it's all in the dressing. The dressing was superb and it made me actually want more of the salad. It tasted like a creamy miso dressing similar to what I've had at Kikusushi in Cupertino. Their salad dressings are the best! The chashu bowl was also good, but it didn't amaze me. I wasn't gravitating towards the bowl as I was more focused on my ramen and salad which brings me to the point that it was a lot of food for a lunch special! I definitely would not have been able to finish it on my own.\n\nI don't know why I've never tried Ramen Taka, but I'm sure glad I got the chance to today!

The chicken is crispy and had a familiar tasty flavor. \n\nAlthough I had my eye on the Miso Ramen, I opted for a lighter broth with the Tonkostsu. If you're looking for a medium light broth I'd try the Tonkostsu. \n\nAlthough we got in quickly and our food arrived within reasonable time, flagging down our waiter to get our check took way too long.

The answer was: \"yes, we use MSG.\"\n\nWell, it's a no brainer to make delicious food using a strong Unami flavor enhancer. But MSG is extremely harmful and if I had know this restaurant uses MSG, I would have never eaten there. It just did not occur to me to ask. \n\nWe also ordered poke and perhaps it wasn't the right thing to order. It showed some thought and level of creativity but the taste and composition were off. The cubed fish that did not have much taste was served on wonton chips (that tasted great), topped with sliced cabbage and drizzled with mayo. The popped chips were not able to hold the fish and even kes's so the cabbage. The mayo was on top of the cabbage. Combined, it created a big mess and was unpleasant. \n\nThe ambiance requires a special call out. Exposed brick walls with old looking Japanese posters of women were cool. The badly mixed electronic video game music with 90s looking visual effects projected on the wall above the kitchen were interesting.

It is a light broth, so I don't feel fat after gulping it down. When I am in the mood for something more fatty, I would get the Tonkotsu Ramen. It is a rich broth full of chicken and pork flavors.

They also have side condiments of garlic which I added a bunch to my soup. Beware, it can be too garlicky and salty near the end. The ramen noodles were thick and just overall juicy and the meat was soft. I liked that they give us a whole egg, compared to other places that give half.

Finding good places to eat that are located near big universities tend to be pretty difficult. However, Ramen Taka provides good ramen that will satisfy your craving despite being in an area surrounded with college kids.\n\nQuality ramen can be difficult to find, and since most ramen places typically are pretty small, the lines can be horrendous. However, the two times that I have come here (one weeknight and one weekend) had me not waiting a single minute to be seated.\n\nThe menu is simple with your different types of ramen noodles and broths. They also have your popular appetizers like takoyaki, karaage and seaweed salad. The first time I came here with my partner I got the miso ramen and takoyaki. The second time was the shio ramen with seaweed salad and atsuage tofu.\n\nI remember the miso ramen being pretty flavorful although the broth is a bit on the heavier side. The wide noodles had the perfect texture and overall, nothing was overly salty. The takoyaki are made to order and fried to perfection before being put in front of you. They are piping hot which makes them all the more delicious. \n\nThe seaweed salad is awesome here. It's not heavy, and despite it being so simple, the sauce it's tossed in really brings out a lot of flavor. I definitely recommend this if you're wanting something healthy and light to accompany your meal. The atsuage tofu is also a great choice. It's deep fried on the outside but silky smooth in the center. Lightly dip it in the sauce that accompanies it and you've got yourself a nice starter.\n\nI was feeling a lighter broth and decided shio would be a good choice. This is chicken based so it is very light. The flavor profile is less prominent than in the tonkatsu ramen. My partner's tonkatsu broth was screaming pork flavor everywhere. Flavor is definitely not lacking, but it did feel heavier than other places. Noodles were still spot on for both. Unfortunately, my partner complained that the bamboo shoots were really cold in his ramen.\n\nYou can make your ramen spicy or very spicy by paying an additional fee to make it so. (Other ramen places don't charge you a different between miso ramen and spicy miso ramen for example). \n\nService here is great. The people here are welcoming, attentive and are quick to help you. We were in and out before you knew it. Price wise, it is on par with other ramen places. A bowl of ramen will cost roughly $11-14 depending on the size (you can get a larger portion) and if you add any extras.\n\nAlthough it's not my #1 favorite ramen place, I do enjoy that it's close to where I live and that it still provides a comforting, warm meal.

I had the chance to go the other day and found it to be a solid place for ramen. \n\nRamen Taka is located on The Alameda in Santa Clara. It's within walking distance from Santa Clara University. (I'm sure half of their customers are students.) You can find it next to an Ike's and a Starbucks. The parking situation isn't too good. There's a tiny lot in the back with maybe 10 spaces. You may only catch a break if you get there early (before lunch hour) or late in the day. There's a security guard there though so it's a very secure lot. (I'm not sure why there's a guard there at all. It's a pretty safe area.)\n\nIt seems like this is one of the few ramen spots which doesn't get overcrowded during business hours. We got there around 12pm and half of the tables inside were still empty. We were seated immediately and ordered our bowls of ramen. Ramen Taka specializes in Hakata style Tonkatsu Ramen. The only other place which makes this kind of ramen that I know of is Santouka inside Mitsuwa Marketplace on Saratoga Avenue. (But that one has CRAAAZY long lines everyday.) \n\nI liked the interior; an exposed brick wall and long bar area where individuals can eat leisurely. I enjoyed the ramen there. They make some solid noodles and broth. They are good, but not amazing. It was nothing unique. I would go back again if I'm in a rush and not looking to wait an hour for some ramen. \n\nChasu Ramen : This has the super thin noodles. The broth was pretty good but a bit too salty for me. My egg wasn't really soft-boiled. The yolks were overcooked. There were many pieces of Chasu. They were thin slices and tender. \n\nTonkatsu Shoyu Ramen : This comes with thicker noodles.

The broth is a blend of tonkotsu (pork bone) and chicken. The miso broth is thicker but also tasty. In addition to being just plain good ramen, they also all include enough toppings to make a meal (including my favorite, the egg!) and are reasonably priced, around $9.50 for regular and 11.50 for large.\n\nThey also have the best condiments at each table; pulverized garlic, a sesame seed shaker, sliced red ginger, and my favorite that I haven't seen anywhere else, \"TAKA\" which is pickled mustard greens. My favorite way to eat the ramen is to eat all the soup and toppings first until only the noodles are left, and then mix that with all of the condiments. \n\nIf fantastic ramen weren't enough, they also have plenty of interesting appetizers.

Definitely.\n\nThere's just so many restaurants doing the same dishes, so how can you possibly differentiate?  It's truly rare to ever get Japanese ramen that you would straight up call \"bad\" right?  I'm not sure if I have ever had ramen that I hated.  Since almost all ramen is better than edible, but they're all very similar, it's really really something when you say, \"Oh God, what is this!?\"...\n\n1. Spicy Karaage $8 \"original spicy sauce, 6pc\":  Very crispy.  Very tender and juicy insde.  Frickin' perfect balance of hot, sweet, and savory.  And... beautiful lookin'.  Need I say more?  10/10\n\n2. Daikon Salad $7 \"water crest, dried young sardines, plum dressing\":  It looks like a spiral dream where you bite into clouds and little crystals of many flavor explode all abound.  Definitely The Best Japanese Salad from a non-Michelin Star restaurant I've ever had. 10/10\n\n3. Miso Ramen $10 (+ Spicy Paste $1.25) \"a carefully selected blend of miso flavors, cabbage, bean sprouts, corn, sliced pork, egg, green onion, ground pork\":  Already impressed with just the appetizers, I didn't think I could be happier... and God, they did it again!  The miso soup is some of the best I've had--very thick, very flavorful, and just slightly gritty to give the feeling there's real ground beans in there.  But the real star is the ramen--some of the thickest Japanese round noodles I've ever had, and perfectly al dente and chewy.  Love love love the noodles.  (Note, these are not the same noodles in their specialty \"Taka Ramen\", which we did not try.)  The eggs are nice and soft, with a good center.  Could be gooey'r, but fine.  My only real criticism is that the chashu is far over-cooked.  It's so tender it pretty much disintegrates between your chopsticks.  That's a pretty big disappointment given how great everything else is.  8.5/10\n\n4. Tsukemen $12 \"dipping noodle, water crest, bamboo shoots, ear mushrooms, seaweed, chashu, miso tonkotsu soup\":  It's kinda rare I get this, but my gf has never tried so I figured I'd take one for the team.  And yeah, I think this might be the only dish I wasn't wow'd with here.  I've had this a few other times, and almost every time it comes with a very thick soup that's almost sauce-like.  The version isn't really like that--it does come with a very strongly flavored soup, but that's pretty much what it is.  Even the description calls it \"miso tonkotsu soup.\"  So, they've basically taken their soup and reduced it so that it's far stronger.  The other places used a heavily reduced stock too, but have added flavors that complement such a preparation, as well as probably some thickener, or perhaps natural thickening from the natural gelatin in bones and cartilage.  Well, I am not sure which is \"authentic\" but alas I do like the others more.  Otherwise, there's the same amazing noodles as the Miso Ramen.  No egg though.  And I should note, it comes with braised pork, but a firm and lean type, not like their chashu.  It's pretty good actually--not dry like the firmness would suggest.  It's different, and I like that.  5/10\n\nAnd I must add--their staff are very nice.  Extremely polite, and look happy to be there.  Everyone greets you in Japanese, with smiles.

I'm a pork broth all the way kind of girl, with no preference on my noodles so I went with the Taka Ramen and was not disappointed. There were a few nice globules of pork fat in my broth but I didn't feel that it was too greasy or salty. My friend's Shio broth was less bodied but still decent.

There is probably street parking, but I was able to get a spot in that rear lot.\n\nThe eatery is airy and clean - this is important to me because I am sensitive to smells (no smells of cleaners or anything unpleasant, only wafts of good food aromas).  I liked the Japanese hangings on the walls - simple and artistic.  The servers were very welcoming and polite.  I was seated at the bar immediately and a cup of water was provided.  \n\nI usually order the restaurant's specialty ramen, but my friend had recommended the Tonkatsu, which did intrigue me with its combination of chicken and pork bone broth - so I ordered the Tonkatsu, which turned out to be an excellent choice.  The noodles had a good snap and clean flavor.  I could taste the chicken overtones in the broth, which was eminently drinkable (a good test for ramen broth).  The egg was perfectly soft-boiled and fresh (it would have been nice to get it seasoned, but that would have been a very minor \"want-to-have\").  The noodles were topped with two sheets of nori and 2 slices of pork that were perfectly marbled - not too fatty, and not too lean - with good fresh flavor.  I have had pork chashu at other ramen places where I couldn't eat half the portion because of the fat, or the pork was too lean or leathery.  Ramen Taka's pork was perfect.  I would rather have slightly smaller portions of pork but of high quality like this.  The toppings included green onions and the fermented bamboo shoots.  I would have liked to have the option to add spinach, corn, or wood ear mushrooms.  None of these were listed on the menu as available add-ons, though corn and wood ear are served in other ramen selections.\n\nI also ordered the karaage because I love fried chicken.  It was a bit of hit-or-miss - some pieces were somewhat dry and tough, others were tender.  I think I will try the tagoyaki or fried oysters next time.\n\nOverall, a great lunch experience.

After all, they've had to deal with me for \"HOW HAS TIME MOVED THAT FAST?!\" years.\n\nTaka is an interesting juxtaposition of traditional and modern ramen restaurants. In my [admittedly limited] experience, more \"traditional\" ramen shoppes in the area tend to be tight spaces with as many tables as can reasonably fit intended to maximize capacity and output; ambiance bedimmed; d\u00e9cor unpronounced. Taka was refreshingly spacious with the nearest table/party a comfortable distance away, open & bright via the large street-facing windows, modern black & red aesthetic, exposed brick & high ceiling, and the groove of Japanese (?) breakbeats & jazz playing overhead. The front-of-house staff are young & tat'd & full of hustle, but attentive & servile with customers and were particularly warm to my parents (as well as other elders in the restaurant).\n\nThe ramen selections are pork on pork on pork. Pork bone broth, pork cutlet, sliced pork. Even the ramen with a chicken broth base is topped with shredded pork.

Some of the other ramens have more picturesque presentations. [Pics: http://www.foodspotting.com/places/808908-ramen-taka-santa-clara ]\n\nTaka offers quite a bit beyond ramen too; we only tried the gyoza and the spicy chicken karaage aside from our ramen, although there were some things like anchovy potato salad and fried takoyaki that sounded interesting. The gyoza are cooked to a perfectly satisfyingly toasted exterior when fresh/hot, but exude a little oil if left to sit. The spicy karaage unfortunately a little rubbery, and regrettably not nearly as spicy as I'd hoped though the server was forthright in saying it was only mild. They have a ramen burger on the menu; I'm not particularly intrigued by this, but other people might want to get at that.\n\nAltogether, is Taka my favorite or contender for the best ramen I've ever had?

We got seated right away and I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen with extra bamboo, and extra spicy paste.  The bamboo is just because I love bamboo, but for those who are huge spice fans, the extra spicy paste really isn't all that spicy.  \n\nThey had the option of Spicy paste, and Extra spicy paste.  Even after order the extra spicy paste, I would still consider it a relatively mild spice, so just don't expect HOT.\n\nOtherwise, their noodle was pretty good, nice and chewy.  Their broth was rich, and their ramen egg was cooked just right too.  The only thing I miss about the egg is that it didn't appear to be marinated at all.  Usually, the ramen eggs I'm fond of are also marinated in a soy based sauce for extra flavour but this one was plain.\n\nThe food was still good though, and I would definitely return!  \n\nAs a side note, my fiancee ordered a Taka Ramen, and although I didn't try any of it, he says the broth was really good.  The noodles are also unique from the traditional ramen.  They are very thin noodles, which might be a specialty of theirs only.  I haven't seen that noodle at any other ramen place just yet.", "name": "Ramen Taka", "rating": 4}, {"index": 333, "review": "Ramen Taka is the newest ramen establishment to hit the Bay Area and their location, ambiance, and ramen offering make it a sure bet to a popular stop for all the ramen aficionados in the Bay Area.\n\nLocated nearby Santa Clara University and opposite street corners to the uber popular sandwich shop Ike's Place, Ramen Taka seems to be one of many new storefront to this area undergoing renovation and with several \"Opening Soon\" signs.\n\nThey have limited hours as they launch, but when I arrived there were already Japanese businessmen spread throughout the ample space.  I liked the ambiance right away.  The interior is marked by high ceilings, brick walls, and has numerous \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" photos to go along with the spaghetti Western-influenced music that I heard as I sat down.\n\nThere's a large common table/bar area for solo diners at the front and numerous well spread out tables for parties of 2 or more.  The layout very much reminds me of local ramen spot Misoya and the servers all yell Japanese greetings as you enter and were all at the ready behind the bar area as I sat down.  \n\nThe ramen type offered is Hakata Ramen which I recently was able to sample at Mitsuwa's Kyushu & Okinawa Fair.  For those that don't know, the broth is the super rich and popular (among ramen hipsters) pork bone or tonkotsu broth.  The noodles are thin and very straight so quite different than what many are used to in the Bay Area.  \n\nMitsuwa's offering was from a super popular Tokyo shop called Tanaka Shoten that had won numerous awards in Japan, so I felt I had a good bench mark to compare Ramen Taka.  \n\nTwo options are available for ordering: Hakata Ramen ($9 with two chashu slices) and their Chashu Hakata Ramen ($12) with many more chashu slices.  Each bowl is served with bean sprouts, the described chashu slices, and half of a soft boiled egg.  Add on toppings include spicy, bean sprouts, whole soft boiled egg, more chashu, green onions, and Kaedama, which basically means you want more noodles added as you're finishing your bowl.\n\nThe other items on the menu include Kobe (the City) style gyoza, chicken karaage, and a fried rice dish.  My order:\n\nChashu Hakata Ramen - it's really a lovely bowl with the charshu spread around the bowl almost like a \"pork belly flower\" (tm).  Only green onion, a few bean sprouts, and the half boiled egg top the milky white broth.  I ordered a whole soft boiled egg and like the half boiled egg, it was cooked a tad too much so that the interior was soft but not gooey and oozy like all egg porn fans love.  \n\nThe chashu was quite good and you can't complain about the number of slices included.  It's thinly sliced, tasty, and well flavored.  It's nowhere as melt in your mouth as Santouka's toriniku pork or as meaty as Misoya's thick grilled pork slices, but it was fine.  \n\nThe noodles, as mentioned above, are thin and straight and a bit harder than the al dente thick curly noodles many like at Orenchi.  I have to be honest, I'm glad they stayed authentic to the type of ramen offering (Hakata is supposedly one of the top 3 types in Japan) but I'm not a fan of the noodles.  \n\nBroth was creamy rich and flavorful without being too oily.  Could have been served a touch hotter, but maybe I took too many photos and it cooled off.  Condiments of thinly sliced pickled red ginger and a cool container of sesame seeds with a built in grinder are brought to the table. \n\nChicken Karaage - ordered a 3 piece chicken karaage for $4 and it was quite good.  It's served similarly to Sumika and is a quality white chicken meat that is tender and piping hot and freshly fried when ordered.  They serve it with a dipping platter of sesame seeds so that may be a regional thing.  \n\nOverall, I'm glad to have another very authentic ramen establishment in the Bay Area.  The ambiance is great and it's clear this place will be popular for students and worker bees alike.  The thin noodles aren't my thing but I think many will stop by for the tonkotsu broth which is one of the most popular broth types for ramen novices and lovers alike.  \n\nRamen Taka is Cash Only, but interesting I noticed one of the Japanese businessman open his long, narrow wallet portfolio and pay with a card that was processed at the cashier.

We never heard of Ramen Taka, but we wanted to give it a try since we were starving. Plus ramen sounded good on a cold night. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was their decor. It was artistic and fun. There was a beautiful mural of koi fishes near the bar, cute chalk board for Kaeda (extra noodles) rankings, and funny animie posters along the brick wall. The entire waitstaff greeted us as soon as we walked though the door and we got a table immediately. \n\nI was in a rush leaving the house earlier and left my jacket at home.

C'mon people, that is great hospitality and awesome customer service right there!!! How often do you get a blanket when you are cold at restaurant? Never. I was surprised they even noticed I was shaking. Good job Ramen Taka! \n\nNow for the food, the menu was simple and many pictures to follow along.  My bf and I ordered the Taka ramen, the house special, and a side of gyozas. The noodles was thinner than what I'm used to, but it was still decent.  The broth was flavorful, rich, and not too salty. The pork was thinly sliced and the soft boiled egg was amazing. The gyozas was crispy outside and soft and succulent inside. Their house sauce on the side is nice and tangy.

Pretty much guarantees to crack a smile regardless of how crappy your day is going. \n\nMenu isn't too extensive, very straight to the point & easy to narrow down selections as a result. I wish they had a spicy ramen option as opposed to spicy bean sprouts (didn't get any hint whatsoever of spice, despite the additional topping fee). First time here, I opted for combo # 3 which includes a cha-shu don (though I assumed these would be thicker/marinated slices of pork belly), though was disappointed to find that the same pork used for the ramen was used to top the rice-bowl.

But I went with their tonkotsu broth and a side of gyozas for that extra kick. So here's how it went down.\n\nThe appetizers and the ramen came out at the same time. I normally care quite a bit about the timing of the arrivals, but I'm giving them a bit of wiggle room since the workers here are probably still getting settled into the hustle and bustle of timing. So how was it? It was pretty damn good! 5 pieces, cooked deliciously, and the sauce was different than most I've tasted, but I really enjoyed it! The dipping sauce that comes with the gyozas is a bit thicker, a bit tangier, and I tasted a bit of spiciness in it (absolutely great change in the normal taste I'm accustomed to). Therefore, I highly recommend the gyozas if you want to add some more to your meal!\n\nNow for the ramen, hmm, I'm going to be in the minority here, but I'm giving it a \"decent\" rating. This is nothing against the chefs here, but to be honest, I prefer the ramen noodles a bit thicker. I absolutely LOVE noodles that have this creamy texture as well as a certain feel of thickness in them; I just didn't get that with Ramen Taka.\n\nThe noodles at this location is thinner than what I'm used to, and the taste seems a bit 'milky'? But that's probably my tastebuds being jerks, so that doesn't count against this location. The soup base is pretty good; albeit, I've certainly had better. It's not that it tastes bad, but I felt that it was missing a certain... flavor of some sorts. I'm glad that it came out nice and warm (AS IT SHOULD. Ramen isn't meant to be smoldering hot, it's meant to be decently warm).\n\nSo overall? I'd definitely come back if my other go-to places seem too far, but I wouldn't put this on my ultimate ramen place. Nothing has yet to dethrone my all-time favorite ramen joint, and that's Orenchi.

Most Ramen places we go to, the host is usually fairly straight faced and focused on getting you to your seat.  But no not this one, she was all smiles.  We ordered their main Ramen the Taka Ramen.  \n\nOne of the first things I noticed about this place is how loud the servers are.

But it wasn't an angry yell it was more of an excited yelling.  Was kinda surprised at first but I started thinking it was pretty fun, they were all laughing and yelling at each other.  The place had a rugged look, brick wall, cement floor, even had this very cool mural on the wall!  Wish they continued the mural across the whole wall!  There's a huge flat screen TV on the wall that was showing the World Cup game, definitely a plus!  They had traditional Japanese music playing, setting the mood, not quite sure what kind of instrument was used, maybe a shamisen.\n\nNow the Ramen, the noodles were the thin skinny kind, not my usual liking as I like the more thick fatter noodles.  However!  they were very good!  The broth, although very tasty was a tad bit too thick in my opinion, it's probably fine to most people but I wish it was a little less thick.  Our smiley hostess was always on top of filling our water and making sure we were taken care of.  After paying and getting ready to leave, I swear to you almost all the people there all said \"Arigatou gozaimasu!\"  (Pardon the Japanese if that is wrong)  Once again they were yelling, they were so excited to thank us for coming.

Hakata, on the other hand, based theirs on the soup complimenting the noodle. The noodles are thin, which is new to me, but then I discovered the \"Kaedama\", where they bring you another serving of noodles. I now don't have the dilemma of \"Damn, that meal didn't fill me up.\". People say the broth is salty, but with the noodles it pretty much negates that.\n\nThey not only have just ramen either. Their variation of a udon definitely caught my eye when someone else ordered it so i may have to try it the next time I'm there.\n\nI took my family here for lunch after church and they loved it here.

All in all, I'd give this review a 3.5, but for this one, I wanted to round down. I was surprised at how spacious the location was. I don't know if they plan on adding more tables; they sure have the space to fit more tables, that's for sure. My coworker and I came in and ordered the lunch special with fried rice. I asked for my rice to-go since I anticipated getting full from the ramen.\n\nThe ramen came out in a sizable bowl, but I was feeling a little underwhelmed. Considering it was my first visit, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The noodles were thin and fresh and very tasty. I was given half an egg and a few pork pieces. I wish there was more in the bowl though. I finished most of the ingredients in the bowl but felt a little unsatisfied. My coworker wasn't done yet, so I continued to sip on the broth.\n\nThe broth was very flavorful, yet felt very fatty. It was a conflicting moment for me: I really like the broth taste, but it also looks really fatty, but it's tasty, but it's fatty... and so on.\n\nI don't know if I would go out of my way to return to ramen taka anytime soon.

They opened recently and have limited hours (I believe they are only open for lunch from around 11-2). I visited yesterday and the shop was pretty empty. Come eat here so it stays open! The decor was nice and Japanese modern and the menu was simple. They had two ramen options: tonkotsu and tonkotsu with more pork. \n\nEveryone at my table ordered a bowl of ramen, the fried rice and the fried chicken.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the ramen. Creamy, rich, salty, thick tonkotsu broth is my favorite kind of ramen (and as a reference point, Santa Ramen and Santouka are my other favorite ramen spots). I had low expectations for the broth, but it ended up being really tasty. It met all my requirements! The noodles they used are different than the curly springy noodles most ramen places use. These are straight and remind me of the homemade noodles Maru Ichi uses. Although I prefer al dente springy noodles, the noodles and the broth really complemented one another and I didn't miss the other noodles at all. The standard toppings that each bowl comes with are modest, not too much, not too little. You get green onions, bean sprouts, half of a soft boiled egg and mushrooms. People who swoon over the Orenchi egg will appreciate the well-cooked egg here. Since it's only half of an egg, the center isn't as golden lava-like, but it's still really good. \n\nI was so excited about the ramen, I didn't pay too much attention to the chicken and fried rice. But I tried a bite of each and they were also very good. Next time, if I come hungrier, I'll definitely order them again.\n\nRamen Taka is in half of the space where Mission City Coffee used to be and two doors down from Ike's on The Alameda.

It's so creamy and delicious and I will get a monster craving for it every once in a while.\n\nIf you get a large bowl, realize that it comes in the same sized bowl but you're just getting more of everything else: veggies, meat and noodles. Of course this means you're getting less broth because it's the same size bowl which is a bit unfortunate.\n\nFor a while they really pushed the \"kaedama\" thing to ask for a refill of noodles. I wanted to try this a few times but almost every time when I realized I was hungry for more noodles, there was such a delay to get a waiter's attention, have them call back the order and eventually get the noodles out to me that I wouldn't really want them anymore. One time this took so long that my broth was cold and skinned over. Really disappointing.\n\nHowever I just get other things on the menu to fill me up which are excellent instead.

The reality of the situation is (as of this writing) that we have exactly one tonkotsu ramen shop in the Bay Area that could serve their ramen in Japan and people would eat it.  This shop is Taka Ramen.  If you want airport quality ramen, go to those other places.  I choose not to.\n\nFirst off, as of this writing, no one serves Hakata ramen in the Bay Area.  There are pretenders, but we currently have none. True Hakata Ramen has a 1cm thick layer of oil on top of the ramen.  Not so appetizing, you say?  Now you know why no one serves real Hakata Rament here.  People won't eat it because of the oil.  Taka Ramen's style is Nagahama, not Hakata.  If you've heard of Ippudo (in New York,) they are also Nagahama style, as their original location is a 5 min walk from Tenjin station in Fukuoka.\n\nNagahama ramen is always served with one or two thin slice(s) of chashu (as is Hakata ramen,)  and the same style thin noodles that Taka Ramen uses (Hakata ramen also is served with the same thin noodles.)  Locals order \"katamen\" which means \"hard noodles\" (al dente, if you like,) and this is why Taka Ramen serves their noodles slightly hard. I imagine you could ask them to cook the noodles a little longer if you really want soft noodles, but I have never asked.  Your ramen is delivered with a goma grinder and picked ginger, exactly as it would be in Nagahama.  If you want to kick it up a bit, order a side of spicy takana (mustard greens.) In Nagahama, ramen will be served with nothing more, so don't mess it up by dumping a bunch of extra stuff in the bowl.  The broth is flavorful and hearty.  The flavor lingers in your mouth as it should.  There is depth of flavors as there should be.  This is the one thing lacking from every other tonkotsu ramen in the Bay Area.  Attention to detail is key when making ramen, and Taka Ramen does it. The noodles are served perfectly \"katamen.\" I was pleasantly surprised at how good their chicken karaage is, as well.  I still think the original Kahoo has the best chicken karaage in the Bay Area, but Taka Ramen is a very, very close second.  Their gyoza is also excellent.  While not correct for Nagahama, they are tasty and have been cooked to perfection each time that I have ordered them.  Their gyoza is actually Osaka style, and they make their own sauce, which is excellent.\n\nThe bottom line:  If you want to eat REAL ramen from Fukuoka Japan, you have only one choice, and that is Taka Ramen.

Oh, and the pickled ginger is amazing and adds the best flavor. The menu is very limited, which I don't mind.

Ramen Taka happens to be one of the places that we wanted to try. Since it was closeby our work, my coworkers and I came here for lunch. Parking was easy since there is a parking lot right behind the restaurant. The moment you step inside the restaurant, the staff will greet you very loudly and enthusiastically. They definitely make you feel welcomed. The menu isn't too big, so you don't have too many options to choose from. I opted for the lunch special for $11, which came with the Taka Ramen and the Fried Rice. Within five minutes of ordering, our ramen came out. I was a bit surprised since it came out so fast. The noodles are quite different from your usual ramen shop. The noodles are very thin and a bit firmer. I definitely prefer the thicker and chewy type of noodles. The tonkotsu broth was also kind of bland. It was creamy and not too oily. I didn't feel too thirsty after my meal, but I think the broth could've been tastier and flavorful. The pork was pretty good. You only get half an egg, but I did like that the yolk was still runny. The portion size of the ramen is a bit smaller compared to other ramen shops. The fried rice was pretty good except it was a bit oily, in my opinion. It was still good when I ate it a few hours later. Overall, I think the staff are very friendly and service was great. Their prices are similar to other ramen shops.

I am probably the third Japanese person to give 5 stars to this restaurant.\nSince I am not from Kyushu, I can't tell if it is truly authentic Kyushu style Tonkotsu or not. (According to one Japanese review, it probably is. But, I can't tell it by myself because I was not born with the tongue of Kyushu people. Tonkotsu is that delicate.) But, I know its a standard Tonkotsu ramen and can tell this is good. The balance between the soup, noodle, and the topping is perfect. I sipped to the last drop of the soup. The topping is very standard Tonkotsu style (green onion, sprout, chashu, sliced mushroom, and soft cooked egg). The table has other standard Tonkotsu seasonings (red pickled ginger, ground garlic, Takana pickles, and ground sesame), so you can use them to adjust the soup to you taste.\nSince Tonkotsu is something either you love or hate, I don't recommend it to everyone blindly. Even some Japanese people don't like its unctuous texture and thin noodle. It actually took decades before Tonkotsu became the mainstream of Japanese Ramen scene. But, once people start to like it, Tonkotsu became pervasive and it is now everywhere in Japan from west to east. So, you could be another one to start to savor it too.\nIn summary, this restaurant serves good traditional Tonkotsu ramen.

They give you one to two tiny pieces of pork and half an egg with the ramen. The broth is super fatty with a thin layer of artificial flavoring or MSG on it. I'd take caution if you plan to drink all of the broth. Make sure you drink their tap water, you will be thirty and hungry after finishing the bowl. The noodles are so thin its like eating nothing. On top of that, there's no noodles in the bowl. I like the fact they have a monthly contest of how many \"kaedama\" (extra noodles) you have, but you have to pay $1.25 for each refill. It may not be worth a try but it's up to you. This place is very roomy, but I don't understand why they don't fix the table orientation because there is a lot of empty space. I guess the empty space is representative of the empty stomach I had after I ate the small and pricey bowl of ramen. Even with a side fried rice, I was still hungry for a steep $12 lunch special.
