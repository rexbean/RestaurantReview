There really isn't very many places around this area with a primary focus on beer. Taplands does a great job at catering to all craft beer drinkers with the variety of selections they have not only on tap but in bottles. As far as atmosphere its not a massive place so it can get busy at times but they just added a new outdoor patio with plenty of seating, its been a great new addition for the summertime. Ive been here a bunch and really enjoy talking beer with the owner Matt and the manager Chris, super knowledgeable guys. Their beers that are brewed in house are great, they really have a homebrew taste to their beers which is great because honestly where can you get that around here? All in all I really love coming here and have had many great nights here! Keep up the good work guys!!", "name": "Taplands", "rating": 5}, {"index": 129, "review": "My new favorite place to have a beer!
