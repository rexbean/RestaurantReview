The interior itself is pretty spacious and has two sections to it. It's a great environment to catch up with someone or work on some stuff if you can tolerate a little bit of noise.\n\nThey offer a wide variety of things from savory crepes, to sweet crepes, to smoothies and acai bowls. They also make pastries homemade that are typically vegan and they are displayed in the front. \n\nThe first time I came here I tried an acai bowl. It was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. The smoothie mixture had good flavor and good consistency, but it was the topping that seemed to be lacking in my opinion. I liked the granola, it had a healthy feel to it, but I would have wanted more, and I personally like the ones that are clustered better. Furthermore, there were strawberries and bananas on top, but I barely had any strawberries. They gave such small pieces to make it look pretty on top, but not the amount I would have wanted on my acai bowl for consumption. I felt a little skimped out on.\n\nThe second time I came here I decided to try the crepes since this place is called Crepes Bistro and you would naturally assume that their specialty is in making crepes. I decided to go for the savory crepe and went with The Works. This thing is pretty big and I do think you could share it but you might not be entirely full if you share the crepe. However, you might have a couple pieces leftover if you try to eat it by yourself. I love the buckwheat batter that they use to make the crepe itself. It's thin and fluffy, and has a nutty, earthy flavor to it. They do jam pack the crepe with a lot of filling as most people have said. I liked the addition of all the veggies and the tofu. The red pepper sauce was definitely interesting, but I think it worked well. They put raw spinach in the crepe which is good, but it has a very raw taste to it and I think I would have liked it better if it was sauteed in with the other veggies for a little to help it cook down a bit. Spinach on it's own can have a bit of a waxy taste to it if eaten all by itself.\n\nI think service could have been improved here. I get that they make everything to order and that they're busy, but it would have been nice to be acknowledged when I was waiting at the register. Both times that I came here I was just standing and no one ever said \"Hello\" or \"Sorry, I'll be with you in a minute.\" I think simple acknowledgements like that can make customers feel more at ease and feel more present.\n\nPrice wise, expect to spent around $10-14 per item depending on what you get.", "name": "Crepes Bistro", "rating": 3}, {"index": 63, "review": "Love, love, love!!!

I had the superfood acai bowl and a latte, and I will come back to try the crepes and borsh another day.\n\nSo, with that said, onwards to the review...\nThe acai bowl was ok - it seemed to have a little more ice than others I've tried, but had a nice texture and flavor (not too sweet).  The raisins in the granola bugged me though - you have this fresh fruit healthy acai bowl, fresh flavors, and then you add dried super sweet fruit to it.  They just don't go together.\n\nI had expected a lot more from the latte - the place had the feel of \"we do coffee right,\" but the latte was honestly worse than any chain coffee shop.  The shot might have been too long, overall it was bitter with a very strong coffee taste.  No pretty foam, honestly - a diner style latte.  Definitely lots of room for improvement.\n\nThe seating area was clean, nice wooden tables, but I was there at lunch time and it was really loud, did not quite feel comfortable.\n\nBottom line is:  this place has potential.

After seeing all of the great reviews, I had such high hopes that maybe I set everything up for failure as soon as my hubby and I walked through the front door. \n\nWhen we stopped by here for Wednesday lunch, we were happy to see that there were plenty of tables left and spacious seating. The interior of the restaurant is very cute with paintings of flowers all around, vases of carnations upon the tabletops, and cutely painted walls. There was even a \"back\" to the restaurant that held more wooden tables. The people who work there are nice and helpful with a great attitude and smile. We walked up to the cash register that was located further into the restaurant and to our surprise there weren't any non-vegetarian options for the crepes (although, that was my mistake for not thoroughly reading up on the restaurant more). But then we decided on \"The Works\" crepe and my hubby got the Italian. \n\nIt took some time for our food to be served. We assumed it was because the crepes were being made fresh, but we would have liked it to come out a bit faster. I also got my crepe way before my hubby got his, so that wasn't good. \n\nTaste-wise, I can't say it was anything spectacular. My crepe had tofu, mushroom, spinach, tomato, and fetta cheese that added a bit of a bite to the crepe. Most of the flavor came from the tomato and cheese, and because the portion was so large, I easily got sick of it after some time. My hubby's crepe was just an abundance of tomato and spinach, but I personally enjoyed his more because the flavor was lighter. The crepes themselves were very good, warm and soft, but the filling left much to be desired. After eating, my hubby advised that we should have ordered one sweet crepe and another one savory, just to balance out the flavors more. We wouldn't say the crepes were bad, but the abundance of tomato and spinach was intensely boring. \n\nConsidering the ingredients that were used to make the crepes, I would say Delicious Crepes Bistro is a pretty pricey place. Most of the ingredients were tomato and spinach, and for about $11 a crepe, it's not exactly cheap, even if the portions are large. I have a feeling that the sweet crepes are better tasting and thus are more \"worth the price.\" \n\nSo overall, we merely felt \"okay\" about our lunch.

The crepe batter I was expecting it to be softer, more like a french style. It was crisp on the exterior and it contrasted nicely with the filling inside, giving it some texture. I didn't find the crepe to be spicy as noted in the menu, nor the tofu, but because there isn't much texture to the filling it's a little harder to distinguish them apart.\n-Avocado Crepe\nI enjoyed this one a little more, because the carrots added some texture and the creamy avocado was perfectly ripe. I wish they added some more filling to the crepe to make it a little heartier, and a little more lime juice to the lemon tahini sauce, but it was still very good overall.\n-Morning Power\nThis was very good, could have used more lemon juice. Definitely taste the herbaceous kale and parley in the front, a little cucumber with a faint hint of celery in the middle and ending with the warmth from the ginger.

We weren't disappointed. \n\nThe parking/ location:\nThe parking was relatively easy to find. They have a lot but there's also plenty of parking on the street. It's surrounded by a bunch of other stores, but I didn't get to look around to see what kind. \n\nThe service: \nMinimal to nonexistent. They take your order, take it to your table and that's about it. No smiles, no nonsense. I had to take a star off for this. I don't expect a lot, I don't ask for confetti and a song while I look at the menu, but a smile goes a long way. It didn't help the person helping us looked annoyed because my boyfriend didn't say the exact name of the crepe we wanted; to quote the famous one liner from Full House \"how rude!\" \n\nFood:\nI naively thought I was a connoisseur of Acai bowls. Im ashamed to admit this was based on my \"impressive\" palate of nearly all the bowls Jamba Juice has to offer. The moment the first spoonful of the acai superfood bowl went into my mouth, I knew I wouldn't be able to stomach down the McDonald's of acai bowls again. It's almost an insult to mention Jamba Juice bowls in the same review as these bowls. The granola waltzed gracefully with my tastebuds, and then handed them over to the ripe fruit drenched in honey to take over. These bowls are priced at nearly $9, but I would sell my boyfriends kidney for them if I had no other way. They will fill you up in the most disgustingly pleasant way imaginable. Your sweet food coma nap will be better than sleeping on a bed specifically tailored to your bad back. Im obsessed. The crepe was delicious and very fulfilling. It wasn't too sweet, but I would consider sharing with someone else because it's too much for one person. \nWould I recommend this to a friend: Im considering bathing my dear mother in acai bowls from here for the rest of her life.

Both are good and I was famished for my late lunch, but the crepe wouldn't necessarily convince me to return. The arugula was absolutely overpowering, which was shocking considering usually olives and sun-dried tomatoes have very distinct and prominent pops of flavor. I could barely taste the acidity of either one, and I had to open it up to check that the eggplant was there. I think spinach would be a much better alternative to cut out the peppery flavor of the arugula, but that's just me. I have been to quite a number of creperies, so when I saw the reviews I may have been overly expectant. \n\nThe soup was excellent (drank every last drop) but I had to remove the parsley. I'm not the biggest fan of parsley so I think that was entirely my personal preference. Nonetheless-- I devoured that soup :)\n\nGreat service! Loved the family style atmosphere.

Cute little place recommended to me by friends, with free wifi (though I couldn't locate the password). Would come again for the food, service was also good, but I was disappointed with the juices- have been looking for a place to get fresh made juices (cold press if possible) in the area without charging an arm and a leg. Hoped this would be it but doesn't seem likely.\n\nGot the special crepe and added mushrooms, ordered to go. This place needs to invest in larger take-out boxes: I noticed other diners had to use tiny boxes for leftovers, and though they take to-go orders, they don't have boxes sixed appropriately to take the order home in and instead wrap a pate in foil. Maybe they were just out of stock today, but I did not get that impression.\n\nThe crepe I got was tasty- half was easily my lunch, and I grazed on the rest off of my desk for the afternoon. The crepe was full of veggies so I liked the healthiness aspect of it, and it was unique, but it seemed to have been made a little too quickly and veggies were closer to raw than cooked/warmed and cheese was not melted. I will probably dine in on a future visit.\nI also got the Green Monster juice, to sample it as a way to see if this place could meet my juicing needs but was disappointed- the juice combos all seem to be a little unbalanced. This one could use beet or kiwi to sweeten it just the tiniest amount. Will be trying others that might still be green but not as bitter, but was disappointed to see that they were served in plastic travel cups- I would think juices would be more likely to come bottled, but I did not hear a juicer going after I placed my order and judging by the amount of settling/pulp in my cup it seems as if it may not have been made fresh. Will ask on future visits if this is an option, or if I can add a fruit to the existing juice combos- that will also reveal whether they are fresh-made or not.\n\nIn short, good food and good place to spend time working or with friends catching up.

They have an interesting largely vegetarian and organic but quite diverse menu. Its not only crepes. Lots of Eastern European/Russian items on the menu. Most of the items are very reasonably priced. Service is friendly and attentive. They have real china and silverware. (I really like that). Nice interior, inviting to hang out (and do some work on the computer). You can even sit outside nicely with fresh flowers on the table. Free WiFi. \n\nFood is very well made. They clearly care. Portions are very decent. The Crepes & Soup combo (nice bowl of soup for an additional $2.25) is a real good deal. Coffee was good. They do single brew as well. The smoothie was good but it was more like a mixed juice than an actual smoothie with the respective texture. (But I'm sure that is something they can fix as they settle in). The smoothies are the only things on the menu that felt priced too aggressive. For the small portion $3 to 4 would be more appropriate.\n\nThis place is both good for coffee drinks and breakfast as well as for lunch. It does compete fairly heads on with the Starbucks a few shops North in the same strip. If that leads to the Starbucks trying a bit harder and to Delicious Crepes staying fresh and not getting complacent, then it's a good things. I hope this is not going to be a zero sum game. I like to see both places stick around. It'll make for a better neighborhood. With the demise of the nearby Mission City Coffee there should be enough residual demand for a coffee house, hang out place in the neighborhood.\n\nUnfortunately, Delicious Crepes currently closes at 4:00 PM, not open at all on Sundays. They are supposedly working on extending their hours. Great if they stayed open for dinner (say 10:00 PM) and had Sunday as well.

This is going to be like three meals for me. It's soooo filling! The coffee they're using is really good. I got a vanilla latte. My latte was too hot when it came out and I burnt my tongue. Hate that weird feeling but it was really yummy so now I know to wait a bit before I drink it next time. It also didn't seem sweet at all. Maybe they forgot the vanilla? They have honey, agave, sugar etc so it was no problem to sweeten it up myself. The crepe wasn't quite heated through all the way so the red pepper sauce was kinda cold in the middle.

I had their Savory \"the works\", the borscht, a coffee, and I tried a bunch of their samples too which were all good.  No beer or wine (which would have been almost too nice of a touch but it's understandable). My only real complaint is this: there are so few true crepe places out there that if you call yourself a crepe place, I'm gonna be a snob and come expecting traditional crepes which these are not.  They are almost heavy salad wraps.  This is good and bad.  If you're a food fan you will appreciate them.  If you're a crepe snob, you will be a tad disappointed because they are more wraps than anything else.  If you can roll with the punches, you'll still like it though and I certainly did.  It was a lot of food however and I ended up taking about half home.  next time I'll go with the piroshki cause I tried a sample and I loved that.  Also, the borscht was killer. Either way, I'm comming back when I can and I will probably stick to some of the more traditional items on the menu which are all made very health-consciously.
