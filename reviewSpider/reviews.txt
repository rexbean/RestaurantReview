I went back up to the counter and pointed out that the receipt shows "everything", but I want nothing on my sandwich except lettuce and tomato (and pastrami, swiss, etc). They say, don't worry "everything" means just lettuce and tomato. OK, whatever. Then they hand me a sandwich with slimy goo on it which they call dirty sauce. Excuse me, I asked for nothing but lettuce and tomato, but this looks like it has mayo on it. Then the woman gets argumentative and says that if I don't want dirty sauce, I have to say so when I order. Seriously, do you speak English? I said NOTHING BUT LETTUCE AND TOMATO. Why is that so hard to understand?2The sandwiches here are phenomenal, but the service is sub par at best. I used the app to place an order as I have done a decent amount of times, so I did it this time to order two sandwiches. When I came in they told me I ordered only one. They insisted I ordered only one, and only conceded the point when I pulled my phone out and showed them my receipt. They then apologized profusely and told me sandwich would be rushed. I then proceeded to wait until every single person still remaining in the store was served, except for me. I had to then explain my entire situation again to someone else, since the person I talked to originally, I guess just left without telling anyone about what had happened.  It took about half an hour to get the additional sandwich that I had preordered. All in all, a poor experience for a very expensive, delicious and time consuming sandwich. Only reason this review gets two stars is because these sandwiches are the best, but if I pay 11$ for a sandwich I expect a certain level if service which I did not receive. Otherwise, just go to subway and save your self some time and $.2The sandwich was not bad, not good either, too much pepper on the pastrami. The ordering though was dysfunctional. Apparently, they don't understand what "nothing but lettuce and tomato" means. I ordered and said "just lettuce and tomato". They handed me a receipt that shows "everything".
