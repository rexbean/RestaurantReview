The interior is fairly clean and polished. They do play their music really loudly usually though. So, I do wish the music wasn't always blasting when I went. Maybe I should recommend them to turn it down sometime.

Their boba is also very fresh. Although I have gotten it before where it tasted semi-overcooked. So I think they could improve with the consistency of boba texture. I have tasted some boba balls that were hard and shriveled up before too. Anyways, I don't complain because I am a loyal customer. Some of my faves:\n\n-Passionfruit green tea (30% sugar): I love this drink because I'm all about refreshing drink and fruit drinks. I recommend this drink 100% if you're looking for a non-milk tea drink! The tea and fruit ratio is perf!\n\n-Okinawa Milk Tea (50% sugar): Super satisfying drink! The brown sugar tasted delicious and the milk always tastes really fresh!\n\n-Peace Green Tea: Another one of my go-to refreshing drinks! I love the flavor of the peach--its fragrant and so tasty. The green tea is always on point too.\n\nService:\nPretty efficient service. The staff are always quick with their hands. They have messed up the sugar level on my drinks before, but were kind enough to remake the entire drink.

I usually try the taro milk teas at various boba shops as it is one of my favorites to get, and you can really get a feel of the bubble tea just by tasting their taro. I got zero sweetness as per usual and was satisfied with the end result of sweetness...not too sweet and perfect for my palette. When my sister tried the boba, we agreed completely that the lack of taro chunks gave it an unauthentic feel to the tea, and the boba was not consistently chewy. Some were yummy and QQ, but a few here and there in between were not at all.\n\nThe store itself is bright and with a clear menu overhead! The staff was quick and our cashier was a friendly dude. I don't usually drink Sharetea since there are a bunch of boba spots in South Bay that I would choose instead--TeaTop, Ten Ren, etc. However, if you're in the area of Santa Clara, Sharetea is a great option to have!

However, there is this one employee that never fails to mess our drinks up. I mean, it's a running joke now. I do not exaggerate by saying...every, single, time. She'll either forget to put in toppings, or forget to not put in ice, or make the drinks hot when we want them cold, or hand us a drink with overflowing creama spilling out all over the cup without cleaning it up. Thankfully the drinks turn out okay, but perhaps management should offer more training.", "name": "Sharetea", "rating": 3}, {"index": 212, "review": "Good quality boba, and the size is pretty big.

Got a free topping reward through Five Star - came to the store, the system is \"conveniently\" down, and no, they can not honor the reward, even though it expires tomorrow.

It's a little disappointing that they don't have Thai Tea or snacks. I mean, I guess we're too spoiled by  all the other competitions in the area, that this is a big minus for them.

I go to Cupertino practically everyday to get my tea fix for jasmine or oolong milk tea. I like fresh milk tea that is brewed fresh on the premises, not pre-made or powdered teas. This place fits the bill. The drinks are a little on the sweeter side, but you can customize sweetness (which I'll do next time). I'm giving only 4 out 5 stars, because while they brew the teas fresh, they do so in larger batches, not individually when you order it.", "name": "Sharetea", "rating": 4}, {"index": 227, "review": "I go here once a week with my sister or my friends.

My sister normally gets the green milk tea with big pearls. And I recently switched it up to the mango green milk tea. The employees here are patient and nice.
