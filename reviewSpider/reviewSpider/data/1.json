Good job, Arby's Marketing Team, because something about those recent commercials got us gravitating toward Arby's as it was down the same street. So, I've never been to Arby's prior to today. There isn't one located in my side of San Jose nor is it the first fast food restaurant that pops into my mind. But whatever, can't knock it 'til you try it!\n\nWe pull up into the Arby's parking lot, and my first impression was that the establishment was a bit run down and dated. The street lamps in the back of the parking lot weren't working, so it just made the place feel unwelcoming. I walk in, and I was taken aback by the awesome menu. BRISKET! WHAT? A fast food restaurant that makes french dips and reubens?! I feel so deprived. Even the apple fritter desserts looked really good. Dare I say even looked more appetizing than a McDonald's apple pie? Too bad I wasn't hungry enough to indulge, so I opted to share a curly fry with the BF and swoop bites of his roast beef slider. \n\nCurly fries were solid, and the roast beef slider was not bad! The bun on the slider reminded me of a Hawaiian sweet roll, and the sandwich didn't skimp on the provolone. While the meat itself didn't have much flavor, the horseradish mayo was what I needed to make the sandwich satisfying for me. Arby's house sauce was alright. It basically was a ketchup vinegar mix. \n\nFinal note, I thought it was cool that the meat isn't already sitting out pre-sliced.

Hey! I was hungry...\n\nAnyways, that thinly sliced beef looks disgusting even on the menu and even in my moment of intense hunger, I couldn't bring myself to order that! \n\nBut my boyfriend did and was sadly disappointed by the blandness of all the food especially his sandwich which was 3/4 lettuce and 1/4 meat- although that was just fine since he said the meat was gross.\n\nWe ordered the little potato things which were actually not potatoes but cheese with a few crumbs of bacon trapped in a deep fried breaded triangle . They were like jalape\u00f1o poppers without the jalape\u00f1os. Or the flavor.\n\nI ordered the salad which looked okay in the menu but was really pathetic. It had hardly-green chunks of iceberg lettuce, cold tasteless cubes of \"grilled\" chicken, a bunch of grated yellow cheese, and a few (two or three) cubes of tomato. I put some ranch on it and ate because I was so hungry. The cheese was by far the best part of that salad.\n\nLuckily, we had a tiny bit of flavor in our meal because we ordered the curly fries as well. They were tasty, but we could have gotten those at Jack in the Box with some other good food and still saved $10.\n\nBig disappointment!\n\nAt least the employees were nice and had some good Mexican music playing in the background.

I was on a mission to Best Buy across Valley Fair to do some very last minute shopping for my girlfriend, and I was pretty desperate to get this done since I wasn't trying to get b*tched out on Christmas Day.  \nSo it's about 5:15pm, store closes at 6, and right as I'm exiting 880, it hits me: a massive lower abdominal pain accompanied by a noise that I'm pretty sure is what a Kraken's burp sounds like.  It was about 4 days worth of crudely digested McDoubles and 5 Layer Burritos manifested into the worst case of the runs in recent memory, wanting out that very instant.  \nI decided I couldn't do it at the mall or Santana Row because it was way too populated; even if I managed to find parking in that mess, a slight bump from a stranger or any sudden stops on my barge to the bathroom would have made me spill among thousands of people and my self-esteem would never ever be able to come back from that.  My only option was to sit through traffic and get past the mall, and find a different place to deposit my chunks.  \nThus commenced the scariest and most painful 10 minutes of my life.  Stuck in holiday traffic, I inched my way towards a destination that I wasn't even sure existed.  Was there anything down this way on Stevens Creek?  Would it even be open?  Would they have a bathroom? What if they have no paper?  What If I don't make it? Am I gonna have to diaper myself up with these Safeway bags in my car and drive back home?  I felt my sphincter getting weaker with each question and I could feel beads of sweat forming in my nether regions.  I was seriously about to cry.  \nBut then I found Arby's.  Abundant parking allowed me to swoop right in front of the entrance.  I rushed in looking for a bathroom, and after a moment of sheer panic, I was told by the nice and friendly cashier that it was out on the side of the building.  There, I unleashed my Kraken, flushed 4 times, and the rest was history.  I ordered 7 dollars worth of value menu food to thank Arby's for their generosity and I was on my way to Best Buy.  \n\nOh and if anybody's curious about the food: dollar ham cheese thing was nasty, the mini shake whatever is seriously miniature, dollar roast beef  was dry and bland.
