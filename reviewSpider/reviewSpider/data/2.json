You cannot go wrong with the value menu, but I had a very specific breakfast meal in mind and Denny's thankfully can serve it up nicely.  The Fit Slam is a good choice if you are focused on trying to limit calories and stick to a healthy meal plan. The egg white scramble is perfectly light and tasty (I add Cholula hot sauce and ground pepper w/ a pinch of salt for flavor). Turkey bacon is another good substitute. Instead of the English muffin and fruit that come with the meal, I asked to omit those and instead get a side of the honey wheat pancakes with sliced banana on top (ask for sugar-free syrup on the side).

It is by no means a fancy place nor is it a spot you would take anyone for a date, but if you're someone like my hubby and I who are always down for something comforting and super simple, Denny's is the perfect spot to go to.\n\nTheir extensive menu offers omelettes, burgers, sandwiches, and special breakfast skillets that will fill you up in no time. You'll have a hard time choosing what to eat because all of those pictures show some great-looking food. The decor of the restaurant looks like your typical diner with booths galore and a long counter-top for those eating solo. All of the waiters we have encountered so far have been extremely welcoming and friendly, so service is definitely a strong point here.\n\nFor this specific lunch date, my hubby chose the meat lover's skillet that came with various types of sausage, roasted potatoes, and two eggs cooked sunny-side up . I chose the ultra omelette that came with mushrooms, green bell peppers, tomatoes, cheese, as well as an English muffin and a side of hash browns. \n\nOur food was served relatively fast and was steaming as soon as it hit our table. I could hear the sweet sizzle of meat from my hubby's skillet and the eggs looked like they were cooked perfectly. I had to have a bite of the sausages and were immensely surprised at how well-seasoned it was! You could really taste the herbs that permeated the roasted potatoes as well. My hubby certainly had no complaints and practically inhaled his food. \n\nAs for my omelette, the eggs held up well and each forkful had a little bit of everything. The bell peppers had a good crunch and the cheese was super hot and gooey. However, I did feel that the omelette veered a bit towards the bland side and would have liked just a tad more seasoning. The English muffin was toasted well and the hash browns were crispy and golden. I can't say I was a big fan of the prepackaged jam at the table since it didn't go very well with the muffin, but I suppose it's more convenient that way.\n\nDenny's is a good place to go to if you aren't looking for something that will knock your socks off. Their food is decently made and it tastes as you would expect. Every now and then, you'll be caught off guard at how great something tastes, but most of the time, you're just left in a content silence as you chow down on typical American-style food. \n\nFor us, Denny's elicits such fond memories of our many \"Denny's runs\" when we were college students who were always looking for something cheap and filling to eat. Perhaps our fondness for the diner stems from our happy memories of ordering pancakes at 2 o'clock in the morning or sharing an Oreo milkshake.
