Very good benedicts, pancakes, etc. The servings are pretty good sized and the flavors are nice. I tried the smoked salmon benedict for my meal and we shared a couple Hawaiian pancakes for the table. I would have crisped up the bagel for the Benedict some to add some crunch but the meal was really good and filling. Plus the drinks were yummy. Even the coffee tasted good. \n\nYou will have to deal with a wait if you try to come here on a weekend. It is worth the wait but you just should be prepared and ready.

Was slightly ignorant as to why is it so hyped! Truth- it deserves every bit of the aura it has earned over time. \nThe vibes are great,hard to miss. If a place comes with such appreciation the 'long wait\" for being seated is just nothing.\n\nWe had our brunch here recently on a weekend,Saturday. Waited close to 45 mins to be seated.

Bread Pudding French Toast-\nThis is most certainly their very flavorful bread pudding which is baked with walnuts and raisins,grilled to perfection. The batter is very rich which adds to the mouth watering taste of this delicacy. It comes topped with a fried banana and their secret bread pudding sauce. Absolutely divine!!\nSince we are vegetarians the part of eggs, bacon or sausage was very politely adhered too and eliminated. Portion size is good too.\nOverall every bite simply melts in your mouth! Very flavorful.\n\n2. Veggie Skillet-\nWhen the worlds healthy veggies fall into your plate the dish cannot be short of one being healthy which follows the great seasonings and flavors.\nThis dish has a collage of mushrooms, asparagus, onions, tomato, spinach and cheddar cheese. Topped with sour cream and chives,it was a very well made dish. Cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I choose wheat toast with it.\nAs again, being a vegetarian I wanted the dish without scrambled eggs,hash browns and it did come the way I wanted. The portion size is great for two.\nWholesomeness!!\n\n3. Bills famous Mimosa-\nChampagne with fresh squeezed orange juice n strawberries which comes served in their famously gaint bowl. Very bright colored to the eye and tongue feels tangy. Balance of the champagne and the juice is pretty good. True,gaint is the bowl and to finish it may take a little while longer.\n\nAs I conclude, all the inhibitions I had for here is now rested. The vibes and positivity both totally justified.

We didn't have to wait, but the tables did fill up. By the time we left, there were a few empty tables so it didn't seem too crazy on a Friday. However, I've heard on weekends it can be a pretty long wait. \n\nI started with a small orange juice. They freshly squeeze oranges to make their orange juice and you can really tell the difference between freshly squeezed and store bought. The orange juice has a few bits and pieces of pulp, so if you don't like pulp in your orange juice, you might not want to get this. The orange juice wasn't ice cold either, but I didn't mind. \n\nMy partner and I shared the crab cakes benedict (the most popular benedict) as well as a build your own omelette plate too. Let's start with the benedict. Everyone has been ordering the crab cake benedict so I knew I had to try it. First and foremost, Bill's knows how to make a perfectly poached egg. This is the kind of egg that ruptures when a knife goes through it and the yolk just oozes out. Now onto the benedict itself, it is luscious and delicious. I've never had a crab cake benedict before but I understand now why people love it. The crab cakes are crisp and they retain their crispness even though the egg yolk drips over. They are yummy cakes without an overly strong aroma or taste of crab. The plate itself isn't very colorful, but boy is it good. If you like crab, you must try this. \n\nWe built our omelette with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, spinach, chorizo sausage and avocado. I applaud Bill's for making an extremely well distributed and organized omelette. The cheddar and toppings were in every single bite. However, the chorizo didn't have much of a spice kick, and the omelette itself seemed overdone. I personally found the eggs to be a bit on the overlooked, drying out side. Hashbrowns come with both the omelette and the benedict, but toast comes with the omelette. We got two pieces of wheat toast that came buttered. The hashbrowns were good, but I would have preferred them crisper. (I'm sure this is something you can request of them though). \n\nService was great. Our waitress was kind and patient with us. She checked up on us and when she handed us our check, she told us that there was no rush and that we could take our time. I appreciated this, especially because they're such a popular and busy restaurant; you would assume they would want to rush you out so they can serve the next set of people. \n\nFor the two plates and the orange juice, the total was a little under $32 without tip.

It's not bad but I wouldn't count it as a crab cake\n-The steak & eggs- I didn't expect much but when I asked for recommendations the waitress insisted the steak there is excellent but me and 3 other people couldn't cut/chew through it. I get it's a breakfast steak but I should be able to chew it.\n-No substitutions- Not sure why? It was a simple fries for salad substitution but it was a no go.\n\nOverall Bill's is fine.

A young Caucasian boy came in and from what I heard he may have quit a few weeks back but came for his check.

Then another 15min or so to get our order after that.  Come on....  and then the food....\n\n1. Coffee $2.49\n\n2. Bill's Famous Bloody Mary $6.50:  Don't you love it when everyone thinks their food is \"famous!?\"  Well, anyway, no.... it ain't famous, and it ain't even great.  Decent yes, but nothing special.  Good flavor, but not great.  Texture was okay, but typical.  Nothing worth getting excited over.  5/10\n\n3. Bill's Famous Mimosa $6.99:  Now... this one has more potential.  I didn't have a sip of my friend's but it does at least look pretty impressive.  Huge margarita style cup.  Floating slices of strawberries.  Nice vibrant bright yellow color.

Corned Beef Hash and Eggs $10.79:  Not my order, but I had a bite... and we unanimously thought this was horrible.  Well, I mean, it was okay, but the hash was clearly canned.  Same crap you buy from the grocery store reheated.  Same crap they serve in elementary schools country-wide.  Same crap your mom heated up when she was tired from a day of hard work.

Strawberries and whipped cream.  Overpriced for such a simple and unremarkable preparation.  5/10\n\n6. Country Fried Steak and Eggs $13.50:  Mixed here.  The fried steak was actually REALLY good!  I've had quite a few over my life, and this one was one of the better ones for sure.  Nice and thick, and very meaty tasting, yet tender.  Coating wasn't the very best, but it was good enough.  But I really loved the meat they used.  The gravy was pretty good too--nice meaty flavor.  Lots of places have crappy country gravy that's almost just flour water, but this one was pretty good.  Biscuits were standard but fine.  8/10\n\n6b. Hash Browns:  Now we get to the mixed part... hash browns sucked.  Outside was over browned and didn't have that crunchy light taste of the best browns.  Well heck, forget \"light and crunchy\"--the crunch wasn't even existent.  Even tasty a bit burnt.  For a specialty place I would expect better.  Edible but not good.  3/10\n\n6c. 3 Eggs (Scrambled):  Ewwwwwwwwwww..........  wow, now these are some of the worst scrambled eggs I've had from a breakfast specialty place.  No effort at all to make them fluffy.  Like eating lead.  And there's A LOT of it.  Says 3 eggs, but could have been more cause it was just a mound of yellow protein really.

After all, every restaurant has its off day, right?\n\nSo with that in mind, my hubby and I stopped by again for lunch with a clean slate and an empty belly ready to be filled with delicious food.

I could taste the egg from the custard and when paired with the maple syrup, the toast wonderfully appeased my ever-needy sweet tooth.

He clearly enjoyed this entree much more than the last time, noting how flavorful it was.

The crab cakes were fine, but I've had much better (my don't I sound like a crabcake snob). Eggs were fluffy, and hollondaise sauce was decent but runny.

The eggs were perfectly poached, and when paired together with the crispy crab cake & english muffin underneath..my goodness happiness! The crab cakes were meaty and very flavorful as well.

For the people waiting outside, they have coffee and plenty of outside seating with shaded areas. Once seated, the environment was pretty lively and bright.

You can add up to five items so I got chorizo, avocado, ham, sour cream, and jack cheese with a side of fresh seasoned country potatoes and your choice of toast. I also got an order of Thick French Toast because I wanted both savory and sweet haha. My friend went with the Crab Cakes Benedict and also chose the fresh seasoned country potatoes to go with it. If whole potatoes aren't your thing, you can also choose fresh hashbrowns to go with your meal instead. Also wanting something sweet, my friend ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast meal which came with a side of two eggs and choice between sausage or bacon. As we waited for our food, I decided to go with Bill's Famous Mimosa, which was very citrusy and delicious (not too strong nor too sweet), and my friend a glass of cranberry juice. \n\nWe were surprised at how fast our food came out since the restaurant was so packed! From ordering and getting our drinks, everything we ordered came within 10 minutes! The omelette was perfectly fluffy with the perfect amount of stuffings and generous toppings of sour cream and avocado to go along. The omelette itself was very tasty with a lot of flavor.

Thankfully Bill's Cafe is around to keep me alive, happy, and full. My appreciation for their classic plates of breakfast staples make me wish they were also in NYC, but alas, it gives me more reason to come back to San Jose.\n\nOf the many locations in the city, this one might just be my favorite. It's not as crowded as one on Willow (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-san-jose-10) or as cramped as location near 880 (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-san-jose-2), but the wait times for brunch can be a bit daunting at first. Patience hungry people, there is more than meets the eye.\n\nFor starters, they serve both hashbrowns and home fries here. After years of enduring the latter on the east coast, I love how they have the option to appease lovers of both. Breakfast potatoes are probably insignificant to the average brunch goer, but they mean virtually everything to me. You can dismiss me all you want, I just really adore hashbrowns that much. Best of all, they're crispy, light, and the perfect side to any hearty breakfast plate.\n\nEggs at Bill's are eggs done right. From fluffy omelettes to an impressive array of eggs benedict combinations (called \"Benedictions\"), they've managed to crank them all out flawlessly. if you're seeking out something specific, try the Barcado Omelette, a delicious bundle of bacon, avocado, topped with melted cheddar and sour cream. Of the Benediction variety, the California (bacon, tomatoes, avocado), Crab Cakes, and Smoked Salmon are key choices, though my favorite has to be the Mexicali Benedict (pulled pork carnitas, avocado, fresh salsa on toasted English bun).\n\nDon't shy away from the griddle specialties, as the French toast, pancakes, and waffles are also excellent. The bread pudding French toast is a fan favorite and the honey oat pancakes are worth ordering again and again. Don't feel compelled to overindulge when coming here, there is a solid selection of \"healthy\" breakfast choices as well as a dedicated area of \"mini breakfast specials\" that is available only Monday through Friday.\n\nWhat keeps Bill's from achieving 5 star status? It just happens to be lunch. I've had somewhat subpar experiences with their burgers and sandwiches (not to mention a very mediocre attempt at a Greek Gyro), but I've learned that all great establishments specialize in something and for this Bill's, it's most definitely breakfast / brunch.

I came in on a Friday morning with a friend and ordered the crab Benedict and the eggs were completely overlooked to the point of the yolk being barely runny and the white part of the egg tasted similar to a hard boiled egg which is definitely not what a poached egg should taste like, and the server never checked on us so I didn't really get a chance to say anything but I decided to just eat it and not make a big deal, I figured it's an off day.. A few weeks later we came back to this same location since it was the closest one to us, I was hoping that this time would be different but it was even worse. I ordered steak and eggs I asked for the steak medium rare and for my eggs to be scrambled with cheese. They brought out my food the steak was extremely well done and the eggs were scrambled with no cheese instead there was a slab of what looked like a krafts single slice of cheese melted onto my hash browns. I flagged the server down and told him the steak was over cooked and that I asked for cheese scrambled with my eggs not my hash browns  and and he barely listened and just grabbed the plate and took it away saying he would fix it. Someone brought the plate back and the steak was cooked even more than it was before and they had just added a slice of cheese on top of the eggs barely melted. At this point we had been there for almost an hour and my friend was done with her food, no one checked to see if the order was right so I had to find a manager and ended up just leaving since it was all taking so long. The food took ages to come out in the first place, was completely wrong and then they didn't even listen to the complaint and got it wrong all over again. You would think the server would have paid more attention since they had messed up already or would have at least checked with us to make sure it was right the second time around but he couldn't have cared less.

Good service, too- we were immediately seated at 8:15AM on a Saturday and offered coffee. BF's cup never got less than half full before he was offered a refill.\n\nthe menu is awesome- so many delicious-looking dishes made it hard to decide what we wanted. I ultimately went with the bagel and lox plate with eggs, since I wasn't all that hungry; while BF went for the portobello omelet with bacon and hashbrowns plus a chocolate-chip pancake.\n\nEverything was SO good- my lox was super-plentiful! Similar pricing for other breakfast places in the area but larger portions: was able to top both bagel halves with lox and still had a giant piece leftover, plus the eggs (which I didn't finish). \nBF was super hungry and ate all of his omelet in record time saying it was really good- avocado, veggies and mushroom plus bacon? I would hope so! He said the hashbrowns were good too, but the pancake was the best! I'm not a fan of sweets at breakfast and don't usually like pancakes at all, but I tried a bite and ended up eating a good third of it.

That is good customer service.  It is very, very loud here as it's an extremely popular place, so fair warning.  Yeah, the wait here is long especially on a weekend, but so worth it.  I've found everything I've tasted to be delicious, but for a more specific review, read below:\n\nSmoked Salmon  Benedict:  Basically, it's bagel and lox with poached eggs and hollandaise.  This is amazing.  Salmon and hollandaise go surprisingly well together.  Capers give it a nice bite to offset the creaminess of the sauce and the runniness of the egg yolks from the poached eggs.  \n\nMexicali Benedict:  Good big heaping portion of pork, and they definitely don't skimp on the avocado.  I personally found the meat itself slightly overcooked and a bit dry but coupled with the salsa, the overall effect was delicious.  Either way for this one, you get a lot for your money.  \n\nCrab Cake Benedict:  I had to try a small bite of this when a friend ordered it, even though I'm allergic.  It was amazing.  It's everything that I've imagined a crab cake to be: fluffy, crisp on the outside, meaty on the inside, and then the egg and the hollandaise, oh...so good.  Makes me hate my allergy.  \n\nBlackstone Benedict: Those red onions in this benedict add a nice subtle sweetness to the the overall warm flavors of the benedict.  The avocado and the tomato added a nice fruitiness to the dish and the avocado especially complemented the creamy eggs and sauce.\n\nBread Pudding French Toast:  Sweet.  Very sweet.  Like cloyingly sweet.  LIke dessert to be shared with all your friends sweet.  The fried banana was delicious and the bread pudding itself was very good, but I found the sauce to be overly sweet, so it was just sweet on top of sweet, on top of sweet.  Overkill.  \n\nStrawberries and Cream Waffle:  Almost 10 bucks and only one waffle and no sides?  What?  Pass.\n\nBill's Famous Mimosa:  Well, that's quite a way to wake up in the morning.  Unlike other places I've seen, this place adds some chopped strawberries and a slice of orange to your drink.  The mimosas come in these big hearty glasses and are definitely (both taste-wise and size-wise) worth it.  \n\nCountry Potatoes (Side):  These potatoes are perfectly seasoned and cooked.  the also go amazingly with the hot sauce.

It's just a mush with a peculiar consistency encased in a thick, hard shell of breading. It was also clearly made beforehand and stayed out for a while before being assembled in the Benedict.\n\nThe Benedict didn't have an actual English muffin, but it was soft and fluffy and not bad at all even if it was room temperature. The poached egg was also room temperature and almost hard cooked, but at least it wasn't too rubbery.\n\nSo it seems nothing was made to order.

Bill's sausage was room temperature, dry, rubbery, and chewy.\n\nI had hoped that the hash browns would be good. They looked really good.

Those are my main thoughts.  \n\nNot at all impressed here.  Probably should give this a lower mark only because the hype doesn't live up to the reality and also because of half and half benedicts which I will talk about later.  I think this is a place that survives on name recognition.  There are like FOUR spots within a few miles radius of each other.  Its like the IHOP of San Jose - tho I like IHOP better than I like the food here.  Others have said that the original Bills Cafe has better quality - and I would hope that to be true because the one we went to was really bad.  Its a example of all the bad things that occur with a restaurant expanding into a chain.  I get the distinct feeling that the original owners must have sold to someone else and cashed out and whoever was the new owner saw this as something to exploit.  \n\nAnyways, we waited in line for 45 mins to get a table.  They had free coffee for all the patrons - but its the kind you could find in any office/cubicle setting.  Fake creamer (loaded with trans fats) and sugar and burned coffee that has been out too long.  Nice though, but poor execution.  \n\nThe best thing about this place I thought was having the option to try two egg benedicts instead of one.  Kinda like getting a half and half pizza, you can get one benedict done one way and another totally different.  I think all brunch spots should adopt this idea.  \n\nThe idea again was great - the execution was very lacking.  The hollandaise was just average.  It was very mild and lacked flavor.  Usually hollandaise is a rich yellow/orange color and this almost came out an off-white color.  The taste also matched the watered down-ness.  The crabcake was way too deep fried.  The corned beef seemed like it could have been cooked a little longer.  And the hashbrowns were cooked a little too long.  It seemed like they must have an assembly line back there because it definitely didn't seem like one person made the entire plate.  Some things were over done, some things were under done.  Even the hashbrowns I ordered were obviously \"cut\" from a much larger piece of hash browns.  That said - you would think that whoever is in charge of cooking the hash browns wouldn't burn it as that should be his only responsibility.  \n\nMy wife got a scramble - and again, I thought this was forgettable after taking a bite of hers.  \n\nFor a place that has 4 stores, almost 4000 reviews in total, and near 4 star plus rating - this place woefully disappoints.

They had to actually bring two plates of food just for that one single order; definitely not going to complain about the portion there.

We ordered a short stack and totally did not expect the pancake come out to be almost as big as the plate it sits on. Looking closely you can see sliced banana embedded inside of the pancake.  Taking a bite of the macadamia bit and banana goodness that sat before me made me feel like I am sitting at the Waikiki beach enjoying the breeze.... well, maybe that's a bit over but you get the idea.

Portobello Mushroom Benedict -- super good (see photos). The 2 poached eggs and the sauce fit together well with the mushroom (of which I am a huge fan). I'd say the portion is a bit too much for me, so I'd go with a fruit side instead of the hashbrowns.\n\nNote:  Hashbrowns--not tasty...sorta grainy. Choose the fruit side dish instead which includes grapes, pineapple, etc.\n\n2. Steak and Eggs -- 'tis OK. If you're a meat lover, this might be a good one for you. You get three eggs however which way you like it, so it's up to you.\n\n3. OJ -- freshly squeezed and delicious. Get it!\n\n4.

This was one of the first places that came to my mind because I haven't been here since my college days back in 2011. As usual, the place was still packed and the wait to get seated was 35-40 minutes (clearly showing that the place was still a great brunch place). The hosts got through calling names and getting parties seated pretty quickly. I wanted to try something new this time. So I ordered a dish from the Benidictions section called \"Eggs Cordon Bleu\" (scrambled eggs, canadian bacon subbed from ham, on a freshly baked croissant, topped with hollandaise sauce and a side of country potatoes). Yum! Even though this was different than my usual order, the food looked/tasted amazing and I was extremely stuffed. One of my friend's dish was really good too: \"Banana French Toast with bacon and scrambled eggs on the side.\" I would highly recommend both dishes. Overall, great food & good service.

I've probably never waited any less than 30 minutes which is a bummer considering they're only open certain hours. The restaurant itself isn't that small, but it really is THAT popular. The parking may prove to be a bit difficult as their own lot is a bit small, but there's a bit of street parking, and there's a lot next to them. I've never parked in the next lot, and I'm not entirely sure if it's theirs, but plenty of people park there so I assume so.\n\nI remember the first time I came here and was super excited because I was craving brunch, but whatever I ordered, was a letdown so it took me quite a while to actually come back the following few times lol. Lately, I've been ordering the Mexicali Benedict and I personally think it is so good. It's a bit pricey at $11.99, but it is surely as good as it is bad for you. One thing I wish they gave more of is the pulled pork because it's a bit lacking. If you like avocado's, you should get an entree with avocado in it, because the Mexicali seems like it comes with a WHOLE avocado sliced. It was so much lol. \n\nThe service isn't bad here, they're attentive, though I would think it depends on where you sit.

So we all sat and ordered our food, and waited only about 35 mins to receive our food it was prepared pretty quick for how many people were in the restaurant.

There's no reservations, and the hostess said it'd be about 45 minutes to get a table. However, if you agree to eat at the counter, it's pretty much first come first served and you can be seated faster. They even have you wait near the check-in stand so no one cuts you. I would have gotten a drink at the bar in front but the Bloody Mary looked a little watery (didn't try it though, so can't definitively say that). As soon as we spotted a couple leaving, we swooped in like seat vultures, not even waiting for the table to clear (they cleared it right away after). The menu is decidedly diner-esque (growing up in NJ, that's no big deal), but it's huge and seems to offer something for everyone. Some of their benedicts were pretty high end too (crab cake, etc). I went with the French toast, as it'd been eons since I last had it. The strawberries and blueberries on top (with the whipped cream, naturally) were pretty good. The fruit seems to just be store bought of the Dole variety, but at least you know it's fresh. Huge portions too--was a real struggle to gulp down those last few bites. I was pretty amazed that even though it was really busy inside, everyone seemed to get taken care of fast. Probably has something to do with the entire waitstaff never slowing down or stopping the entire time. The goal is to get you in and out fast, and they accomplished that. They have a tv in front too that shows college football for the sports-minded.

They are frequently long (at least on weekends when most people go out for breakfast). They frequently extend outside of the establishment and into the parking lot.

As for the atmosphere, this cafe had a comfortable, established air about it (no surprise -- 35 years and counting!) with plenty of light, which I liked.  \n\nNow for the best part:  the food.  When it comes to breakfast, I tend to go for more savory items like omelettes, bacon, and the odd hash or skillet.  However, when I saw the Parisienne French Toast, I was immediately intrigued.  A flaky croissant, dipped in egg batter, fried, and sprinkled with powdered sugar, and accompanied with more butter and syrup?!  That spells indulgent right off the bat, especially in these carb-conscious times!  Accompanied with eggs and the three of largest bacon strips I have ever stuffed in my gullet, it was heaven!  My husband ordered the cinnamon roll french toast with eggs and bacon.

Awful. The manager, George, was rude and condescending when asking for the small request of bacon as a substitute on a takeout meal.  \n\nFull Story: \nI discovered Bill's Cafe in San Jose last week from yelp, saw the many good reviews, and went here three times while my father visited from out of town (translation- we loved the food, so kept coming back).  I am on a strict \"no-carb\" diet and each time I went I ordered the \"Bill's Steak and Eggs\" and asked for a substitute of bacon (instead of the muffin, fries, etc... basically carbs).  The substitute was at first questioned, but then gladly received. I thought \"wow, this is cool\". Food was great- and each time they were willing to substitute something decent for the \"hash browns, muffins, toast, etc\"- in this case, bacon. \n\nBefore leaving the last time I was there, I asked if they did take-out. The waitress said \"yes.\" Awesome- I thought to myself. I finally have a place where they have good breakfast food that I can get takeout from. \n\nSo today, a day after the last time I was there, I called to try takeout for the first time, with the plan being to order the same thing. I asked for the substitution and was flatly told by the girl who picked up the phone (after asking her to ask the manager) \"no, we cannot do a substitute for bacon.\" When I asked how much the bacon was ala carte, \"$4.50\" was my answer. $4.50 for ala carte three slices of bacon is high, so then I asked to speak to the manager, whose name was George. \n\nWhen George picked up, I explained my situation and the fact that I'd like to get bacon as a substitute. He said he \"couldn't hear me\" but when I relayed my story and told him that I had received the substitute not once, but three times visiting in the last week, he started to question me, asking me \"when were you here- I was here all that day and no one ordered that.\" I replied \"ok, I can bring  you my receipts if you're questioning me... but I know what I ordered.\" It was like he was weirdly challenging me. Strike one. \n\nAnyway, Bill's Steak and eggs is $13.50, and I had received the Bacon as a substitute for all of the \"filler\" carbs in the meal each time I went in person. Without adding the bacon as a substitute, you're talking almost $20 all in for a steak, a few eggs, and bacon for ONE PERSON takeout. Now, I'm the type of person that likes ritual- most people do. I probably would've gone there at least 3-4 times a week and ordered the same meal, if they had been willing to do the substitute each time. I relayed this to George next and he almost mocked me- \"you're going to order the same thing every time??\" he said. \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Like I said, I am on a strict no-carb diet and I'd order often.\" \n\nGeorge just kept on saying that he couldn't do it. He said he \"had to follow the rules.\" Hmm... makes no sense that I had gotten the substitution three times in the last week then. It also shows that George isn't flexible in his help as a manager. I was getting nowhere, so it was at this point that I said \"well, I'm surprised that you won't do the substitution, you're going to be missing out on a lot of business.\" To which, he apologized, but it was pretty obvious that he didn't care about me or my business. \n\nI then ended the call. After hanging up,  I started to write this review right away. His questioning of me and lack of any flexibility at all weren't satisfactory. However, I wanted to give him a final opportunity to make the situation right. So, I called George back and flatly told him \"look, I don't want to write a review on yelp, but I've never had a reasonable substitution request denied, so I'd like to give you the opportunity to fix it.\" \n\nGeorge's response, in a terse, challenging, rude way- \"You're going to write a one-star review on yelp because I won't give you a substitution of bacon? Great, I hope you write it so I can respond.\" Well, George, here's your chance. \n\nThe moral of the story: \nI come from the East Coast and I have never had a legitimate substitution denied with such, shall we say, attitude? This is not a review of the food- it's great. It's a review of the establishment's flexibility and, in particular, George's attitude when dealing with a potential good future customer. He obviously didn't care about my business, and the place is packed so I'm sure it won't matter, but whatever happened to \"the customer is always right?\" We're talking about substituting a side of bacon here... I've been to MANY diners, both on the west and east coast, with it never being a problem. EVER. Very disappointing and I am surprised how \"penny wise, dollar foolish\" George was in the exchange. I was also surprised at how quickly George became \"standoffish\".  An attitude adjustment is sorely needed, I am afraid. \n\nIn the end, I'll take my business elsewhere and vote with my pocketbook.

I took a bite of the crab cake and found it tasty, though I was a bit surprised that it was more battered (not to mention firm and stayed intact even after my fork cut into it) than the other crab cakes I've had at other places.  I took a closer look and discovered that it was not made with real crab.  I was quite disappointed because the menu did not indicate that it was made with imitation crab.  I did bring this up to the waiter and to George the owner.  Just thought they should have indicated the imitation crab part on the menu.

Topped with two Eggs - any style. Now when I think of skillet I think of this pipping hot mix of yummy goodness on a plate. This was not that. It arrived on a regular white plate which sort of surprised me because most places when they say \"Skillet\", it comes out on a skillet and piping hot. It looked good but the cheese was not what I had expected and the food was more like medium hot then really hot. When I got through about halfway of my dish, I had to stop. The cheese got to be super oily and was sitting at the bottom of the dish making the dish really oily and not to my liking. I didn't even bother taking it home and generally I like taking my breakfast leftovers home to eat later. \n\nMy husband ordered the Eggs Cordon Bleu which is baked Croissant, we layer thinly sliced Ham, Swiss Cheese, scrambled Eggs, and creamy Hollandaise. He asked for the Hollandaise on the side because the dish was really rich already. He thought it was okay but has had better. I think he was hoping for poached eggs instead of scrambled which he thought was weird for a Benedict. \n\nCoffee here is blah!

If you have to wait though, there's free coffee just for you! The service here is pretty decent, and they try to seat you as quickly as they can though. If you call ahead, you can get your name on the waitlist as to minimize waiting time =) My boyfriend and I used to come here every Sunday morning, but he has since moved further away and it's not as easy to make it here as often as we'd like now. We were just here last weekend for breakfast, and everything is exactly as I remember it to be! A review of my favorites:\n\n- Belgian Waffle (traditional, blueberries or strawberries & cream): This is the very first thing I had here, and it was what drew me in. The waffles are giant and filling, and they use real fruit to top it. If you're lucky, a Nutella waffle is sometimes on their specials list, and this is the most killer waffle I've eeeever had.\n- Parisienne French Toast: Giant croissant slathered in egg batter and grilled? I'm in! This is my sweet-tooth breakfast item when I'm craving something sugary and totally bad for me.\n- Bacado Omelette: Bacon and eggs and avocado with cheese, what's not to love? They never skimp on the bacon, and they always give you tons of cheese for that perfect gooey-ness. Omelettes are a classic breakfast favorite, so if you're not feeling adventurous, this is definitely the breakfast for you!\n- Crab Cakes Benedict: After reading all the reviews about how good this was, I finally had to try it. This is definitely a new favorite, and I've discovered a new love for benedicts. The crab cakes are crispy, the eggs are poached to perfection, and the English muffin and hollandaise sauce make it a benedict indeed!\n- Poached Y Papas: This surely high calorie item is definitely a winner. Surprisingly, it's a benedict! I love potatoes in the morning, and this dish is like a breakfast baked potato because it's topped with all of my favorites: bacon, cheese, chives and eggs. The hollandaise sauce reminds you that it's still early in the morning, so you have plenty of time for the rest of the day to walk this off.\n\nLove love love, I'm so in love with Bill's.

Not too long ago they opened a new location near the Rose Garden, and just recently a third one on The Alameda.

It's done with nice thick bread, is perfectly cooked, not too eggy, and is finished off with powdered sugar and some cinnamon.  Perfection with lots of butter and syrup.  YUM. \n\n-Southern Scramble\nOMFG...artery-clogging-southern-style-FANTASTICNESS-in-a-skillet.

I brought my out-of-town aunt here and she was quite impressed with the egg-white omelette and fruit that she ordered.  She said it was quite yummy!\n\nOther favs of my hubby, which I've been told are really good, are the Mexican Omelette, the Chilaquiles and the Mexican coffee- which is Coffee, Tequila, Kahlua and Whipped Cream.  He DIES for this stuff.  Haven't had it myself, but he loves it so much that he has taken up the practice of trying really hard to recreate it at home a time or two.  : )\n\nBill's is definitely a very busy place....expect a little bit of a wait on weekends.  But, actually, even with how popular it is, I honestly don't think we've had to wait much longer than 5-15 minutes at the most for a table.  Maybe we get lucky because we tend to not make it out for \"breakfast\" until later in the day...say 1-2pm.  That seems to work out well for us.\n\nWe did have a not so good experience with one of the waitresses at The Alameda location this past weekend, but it won't stop us from going again.  Honestly, if we've only had one bad experience after going there so many times, this place is clearly pretty darn good.\n\nDefinitely a must-try place in San Jose.

I visited the cafe before the holidays on a weekday after the morning breakfast rush. When I entered the Hostess had her nose buried in her cell phone, texting away.

I took a seat at the counter and waited for a server to visit, give me a cup of coffer and silverware.

I'm a big hot chocolate fan when I have breakfast out and this was nothing special. My Gorgonzola Scramble I will admit while small was good. The toast was decent with a good amount of butter.

My friend enjoyed his French toast.\n\nThe last word: Fabulous!", "name": "Bill's Caf\u00e9", "rating": 5}, {"index": 1717, "review": "no more denny's for me afte r i ate here. geee wheez why didn't i discover this place a lot sooner. would've save all my money from denny's and ate here instead.", "name": "Bill's Caf\u00e9", "rating": 5}, {"index": 1718, "review": "Took my son to Bill's Cafe this morning. I have been wanting to try Bill's for some time. At 9:45 we were seated as soon as we walked in and had no trouble finding parking as the other reviewers noted. Yep, it is crowded and loud but no different then any other popular breakfast spot in the bay area. We decided on a sugar high and opted for pancakes. My son had the chocolate chip pancakes and hot chocolate, and I had the regular buttermilk with a side of bacon. Everything was hot and tasty and served very quick. There's quite a selection of different types of pancakes ranging anywhere from \"Almond Joy\" to \"Hawaiian\" but I thought the standard buttermilk was a good starting point. Nothing over the top outstanding but very good nonetheless. Service was excellent, waitress checked back several times to make sure everything was o.k. and when paying the check at the register the gentleman asked if everything was good,.  They actually do care about what they are serving. They have a huge menu with a large variety of omelet selections and different varieties of French toast made with everything from croissants to cinnamon rolls.

Good service all around also, very attentive and friendly waiters.

Not only is the food great but the staff is outstanding.  Every single time I have been there I am blown away at how sincere and helpful each staff members is.  The service is unbelievable and it seems like everyone loves working there!  I even see the manager helping every one out on busy weekends, and offering people coffee etc.....  One particular waitress we had was absolutely incredible.  Her name was Suzie and she took such great care of us that we were all in a great mood after our brunch.  It was like scene out of a movie where the waitress is so sweet and actually cares about her customers:)  She took extra special care of me b/c I am pregnant and she made sure I had everything prepared exactly how I wanted it.  This restaurant, the customers, and the manager/owner is beyond lucky to have Suzie as an employee.

My friend Lisa M raved about it so I knew it was a place I had to go to. A few weeks back I brought a bunch of friends here after a long night of drinking from a great wedding.  The first thing I notice is the free coffee and the display of beer they have for sale.  When we sit down for breakfast and finally get our meals, I smiled at how much food came our way.  I had the Parisienne French Toast and I expected something to look like a crossaint, but I got something so much more yummy. Plus I still had another plate of just side dishes.  Needless to say everyone's food was great and my friend who order a bloody mary barely good finish it due to the amount of alcohol in the glass. The bloody mary was actually almost pink. It was like a 50/50 mix.

We're regulars at the Bill's Diner in the Rose Garden, so when this new location popped up we were anxious to compare it with the other Bill's location.  We dropped in for breakfast the first weekend it was open.  Word on this new location opening up must have spread quickly, because the restaurant was full when we arrived at 9am on a Saturday morning.  For those that had frequented Cozy's Diner before, the decor has not changed.  For those that have frequented Bill's other locations, the menu has not changed.  The food?  Good.  A few things need ironing out, which is normal for a new staff.  When we arrived the busboy rushed to clean the table, and didn't do a very good job - we had to wipe off the seats and push aside some small trash left on the table.  The 1/2 & 1/2 hadn't been re-stocked, so we had to ask for more.  Bill's was serving free mimosas to celebrate the grand opening, and they were pretty good, except someone in the back forgot to wash off the orange that they sliced for garnish on the mimosas - it still had dirt on the outside of the rind.  Other than that, the food was OK - pretty comparable to the Bill's in the Rose Garden.  Apart for the fact that the  avocado on my veggie skillet was a bit brown, the rest of the dish was tasty.  My husband's muffin in the Egg's Benedict needed more toasting, but they have that problem in the Rose Garden restaurant as well (I don't know why they don't take the time to put a decent \"toast\" on the toasted muffin).  The waitress, although new, was doing her best to memorize the menu, and she was quite pleasant and polite.  The kitchen messed up my order but the waitress caught it before it came out, so my food came out a bit later than my husband's, but it came out correct, which I appreciated.  All in all, the new Bill's has a few kinks to work out, but what new restaurant doesn't?  We'll definitely be back, and give it another go.  I'm sure it will improve over time.", "name": "Bill's Caf\u00e9", "rating": 3}, {"index": 1730, "review": "Great breakfast place, delicious omelets!!! I'm also a huge fan of their mimosas.
