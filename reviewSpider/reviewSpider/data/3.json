Not to mention is was 8 of us, not something ridiculous like 20. So I then asked to be seated somewhere with a bigger table. They moved us from the bar area to the \"dinning room,\" where we were serviced by Imeh who was a great servicer and was very personable and funny! A nice change from the poor service we were receiving and I'm glad we had him. Anyways, we ordered a few more drinks and food and when the bill came none of our meal was happy hour priced. We asked to speak to a manager once more. He pretty much told us too bad, that we had moved to the dinning room and there was no happy hour there. We explained to him that he himself had placed us in the dinning room not giving us any other alternative so it's doesn't seen fair.

I have been a server for the past four years so I know how difficult it can be when a guest seems unreasonable. But we did not make too much off a problem and even ended up paying a great deal more than our bill should have been!
