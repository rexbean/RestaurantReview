[{"index": 0, "review": "I want to start this review by going over some of the things for the last year that people have really been upset about.\n\nThe biggest issue seems to be that this fast food self serve restaurant does not give free cups of water and that if you want a carry out box or extra napkins there is a small charge. They also mentioned that they only allow one refill on the soda. They consistently bring up the rude counter people who get the order wrong and won't make it right. \n\nI am not here to dispute these claims or defend the owners of this franchise. As an Elite Reviewer, who previously reviewed the L & L in Campbell (5 Stars), I want to review this restaurant in a fair and impartial manner.\n\nThis restaurant is a family run franchise going on it's 11th year. It is located in an expensive rent shopping center near Target off of Coleman Avenue, a very busy area. \n\nIt is always busy, especially during lunch time and in the evening. The prices are VERY low. An average meal with beverage is under $10.00.\n\nThere are usually long lines and if you have hesitation or not sure what to order, they will take the next person in line (I have witnessed this). They charge less than a dollar for cold bottle water and a fountain drink (with 1 refill) for under $2.\n\nMost places charge a higher price to compensate for the extra refills, water cups and extra take out boxes/napkins.\n\nI don't have a problem with this as I have seen this at other low priced fast food restaurants before. Most donut shops do not give free cups of water. This is not a full service expensive restaurant.\n\nNow for the food. I have tried many dishes, including the chicken dishes which are high quality dark meat with a marinade (not greasy). The Garlic Tilapia is amazing and my favorite is the home made macaroni salad. I usually order another side for $1.50. My average bill, including beverage, extra side and a bottle of water is under $14.00. The rice is always perfect and the quality and preparation far exceeds many expensive restaurants I have experienced.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and I have never experienced (nor heard) any rude service from anyone. I also understand that if a customer does not get what they want, they will be upset.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.", "name": "L&L Hawaiian Barbecue", "rating": 5}, {"index": 1, "review": "ATTENTION:\n\nThis L&L has terrible customer service. You can tell the manager is failing in her business because they don't allow returns and exchanges. She said once the ticket is sent to the cooks there are no returns. \n\nI ordered a plate and questioned the cashier whether he was charging me for the right size plate. He swiped my card before confirming what order i received. \n\nThere was enough time for the cashier to pull the ticket but because the manager was wasting time talking to customers she said it was too late.\n\nEven the cashier seemed scared to offer me the refund, which means she probably puts too much pressure on her workers to save a little bit of money.\n\nWill never go back here and I'm not editing my review.

I am perfectly fine with paying extra, but don't laugh in my face about it.   Seriously?  I should have not even continued to order after that.  Plus like many others have said before, this location doesn't give out free water cups, like other L&L's do, so you are forced to buy an expensive bottle of water if want water.

I am currently 8 months pregnant and need to stay hydrated at all times so I also asked for a cup for water.  Their response?  \"we don't give cups for water.

If you want to know what people in hawaii eat, and the portion size they devour, this is the place to find out.  Of course it's a franchise, but for some reason i find it amazing how accurate the taste is to the same establishments in hawaii.\n\nI love the Katsu Curry, but the last time i was there they were ultra skimpy on the curry...i was a little upset.  By the time i received the meal, there wasn't any curry except for what had soaked into the chicken katsu...usually there's at least enough to spread on the rice a little...sheesh!\n\nThe portion size is large and you probably won't go home hungry.  I typically recommend the BBQ plate to people that want to try a little bit of everything since it includes Teriyaki Chicken, Teriyaki Steak, and Korean BBQ Ribs.  I typically DON'T recommend the Manapua and many of the \"side\" items because they are just way too expensive for what you get (Manapua = $2.25, but you can get them in Hawaii for $1 or so).  It's not like they don't have the Char Siu Bao (bbq pork pun chinese equivalent) somewhere else down the street for even cheaper.\n\nIn the end, these places are really only as good as the last meal you've had there (and i wasn't really happy with my last meal there), and honestly, i've spent too much time reviewing this place in the first place.\n\nHappy Eating!", "name": "L&L Hawaiian Barbecue", "rating": 2}, {"index": 283, "review": "Food is okay here but the 1-star review is mainly due to the customer service.

I thought, how could you get katsu and curry wrong? Well, I tried it, and they managed to get it wrong. It was very bland. I think the curry could have used more seasoning. The chicken definitely tasted like it came from the freezer. Overall, I thought it was  a pretty good experience and I'll probably come back again and just avoid the katsu.
