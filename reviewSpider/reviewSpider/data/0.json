This was a mistake I personally take responsibility for because I had the wrong expectations.  Great Cuban sandwiches are made by real Cubanos in places like Havana or the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami.  A special sandwich press is critical to get these right.  I know this.  I know better, however I saw Cuban Sandwich on the menu and said to myself, \"I LOVE those, I'm gonna get that.\"  I didn't like this sandwich at first, but once I realigned my expectations it was okay.  It's a Togo's sub with Cuban Sandwich ingredients on it: pulled pork, ham, cheese, mustard, pickles, sort of smashed.  If that's what you want it will be good.  The pressing was where it really failed and the ingredients were fast-foodish, not foodie-foodish.  I knew where I was, I rolled the dice, not great but as a Togo's sandwich good for sure.

I got an immediate reply with an email address to explain fully what my unresolved issues were. A few days later I got a note saying they were going to share some feedback with the store, and they were sending me a gift card. I can't give the store more stars yet, until I see the orders are correct more of the time, since that is what my complaint was about. But I *am* willing to give the store another try because of the excellent & responsive customer service!", "name": "TOGO'S Sandwiches", "rating": 2}, {"index": 47, "review": "Like any other togo's the sandwiches are pretty good.\n\nUnlike most other togo's ive been to before, this one is kinda dirty.

My order is correct less than half the time I come here. Today, I ordered avocado on my sandwich. They told me it would cost $1 extra, which I didn't mind, so they charged me. I got home to eat my sandwich and there was no avocado on it. Last time I came to this location, the lady making my sandwich asked me if I wanted a large sandwich, and I told her three times, \"No, regular.\" Well, she rang me up and it was a large sandwich. I didn't want the food to go to waste, so I just paid for it and left. The time before that, my dad ordered a sandwich, got home, and there was no meat on his pastrami sandwich. He went back and they added the meat, but it was an inconvenience for him to go back and they didn't compensate him. I'm done being duped by the incompetent employees at this location. I will instead go to the one on Lafayette. It's a bit further from my house, but at least I know they can get my order correct. I'd also like to add that the scratchiti at the food counter was unappealing.", "name": "TOGO'S Sandwiches", "rating": 1}, {"index": 49, "review": "I LOVE this Togo's!

I have nothing bad to say of the other employees but she has helped me the most and she is so nice and helpful every time!  Also The manager there (i think he is) is a very nice guy.

Was a really good sandwich, I'll probably be getting that more often, but there were some good & bad things to share, about this Togo's:\n\nGood:\n   * Service was good, my sandwich maker was articulate (in making the sand) and the lady taking the cash was enthusiastic and smiling (oh how rare~) everyvbody was moving fast trying to keep the line moving.\n   * Sandwich ingredients were fresh and tasty, turkey which I usually don't like, or maybe thought i didn't like, i liked~\n\nBad:\n   * Location, location, location.  This surroundings of this location suck.\n   * Sits directly next to a shady laundromat, and an old 7-11 and a busy VTA bustop, perhaps the worst combination for quality of neighbors and peace of mind while exiting your car.\n   * 2 girls, SC High school students cutting class, sitting on the ground next to the entrance, asking for money.  Always lots of kids \"hanging out\" in the parking lot.\n\nSubway doesn't have this particular sandwhich, but you can order a Turkey with Bacon, w/Bacon as a side for $6.99.  Taste-wise, they're comprable but Subway is 12\", 3 more inches, but seems like its mostly bread than meat.

Told the lady my first sandwich, (turkey and cheese). She proceeded to just start making it without asking me one question.. Hello I am the one who is going to eat it, right? I look over the counter and she has already put on a ton of mayo without asking, and a ton of provolone cheese.... Uh, excuse me but had u asked I want cheddar. Told her I wanted cheddar. (she mumbled oh I put provolone). Duh, I see that, had u bothered to ask u wouldn't need to redo anything.  Next sandwich, told her to scoop the bread out of the middle, she says \"ok\". Then proceeds to NOT scoop and once again put mayo all over to which I said \" I only want mustard\" but she wouldn't know that cause she didn't ask. She did nothing to remove the mayo she put on without asking.  She never once asked me how I wanted my sandwiches made. Got home and my boyfriend opens up his sandwich that was the turkey and cheddar... WOW she LEFT the provolone cheese on it.
