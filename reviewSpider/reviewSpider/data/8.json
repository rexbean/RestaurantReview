[{"index": 0, "review": "We have ordered from New China Garden via Grubhub a few times now.  Food is always delivered quickly and hot!  Maybe that is due to our proximity to the restaurant (approx 3 miles).  It's an American Chinese food.  Ether than Panda for sure. \nWe have tried different items and have been satisfied with them all. Mongolian beef is tender and tasty. The Generals Chicken is mild with a tasty sauce - could be spicier.  BBQ pork fried rice is good with generous portions of pork. The dumpling filling is very good but the dough is a bit think for me. \nChicken Chow Mein has large pieces of chicken but is a tad dry. \nGreen Onion pancakes are the one . \nAll in all food is good, a bit pricy after delivery.", "name": "New China Garden", "rating": 4}, {"index": 1, "review": "The food served here is entirely lacking in flavor.  This may be appealing to some but it's unlikely the case for most.  The portions are very generous and the food is cooked well (perfectly crispy fried items and all the meats are tender) but other than by texture I couldn't tell the difference between the house-special fried rice and the lemon chicken.  We also had the BBQ pork chow mien and sweet & sour pork, no flavor.\n\nDespite the large portions I expected better for the price, dive restaurants can get away with a lot (lack of cleanliness, decor, rudeness, parking) but not with lacking flavor. \n\nWould love to see this place succeed, clearly family owned, hopefully they spice things up in the future.", "name": "New China Garden", "rating": 2}, {"index": 2, "review": "Ordered this in for dinner...total disappointment. Cashew chicken had no flavor and the beef with broccoli just tasted salty.

No duck sauce for the egg rolls, just sweet and sour sauce (which is not the same thing). \n\nThe only things out of the entire order that were edible are the steamed dumplings and the green onion pancake They were pretty ok. \n\nHate leaving bad reviews but I'm pretty upset that after dropping more than $40 bucks on this I was still hungry because the food was so unbearably awful.", "name": "New China Garden", "rating": 1}, {"index": 3, "review": "Okay... \n\nI first have to disclose that I hold a strong bias when it comes to Chinese restaurants.

What arrived was made wrong, tons of garlic and red pepper, when I asked for both to be left off.  Maybe I need to learn more but zucchini and bell peppers in the beef dish?? really??

They have take out or dine in. The atmosphere is casual, clean; with a calming aesthetic ambiance. It's family owned and run . The prices are reasonable, if not a little cheaper than most Chinese restaurants. There's a real \"homey\" vibe to the place, as occasionally the locals from the Neighbourhood come in for their \" to go\" orders and chat with Bi, the  ever friendly daughter and host/ server, with an engaging smile that makes you feel welcomed ; or the mother, just as friendly; but not as visible . Because she's either in the kitchen or behind the counter. The father you don't see because he's in the kitchen preparing the food.\nLike I said this is family style home cooked food , not \"fancy shmancey\" pricey fair . But if you're hungry and especially if you have a family , or a special someone that you want to share some time with and have a nice intimate dinner with; then this is the place.\nI was in China last year and there's a difference between American influenced Chinese food and \"Chinese\"- Chinese food ! This is like the latter !\nTry the Beef Chow Fun, great ! ; or maybe the Mu - Shu pork. Soup? Try the Sizzling Soup ( yum ! ). I've got to stop ! I'm making myself hungry ! whatever you choose I'm sure you'll be pleased . \nSo if you're looking for good authentic home style Chinese food at  a reasonable price , check this place out !!\nAnd maybe I'LL see you there !", "name": "New China Garden", "rating": 5}, {"index": 6, "review": "I could eat at this restaurant weekly, the service is good, the food is fantastic!

The first time I ordered my all time favorite, some sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. I ordered a bit later than usual dinner time and found it weird that they only allow combo plates during lunch hours. They also only seem to have 1 size when ordering, ordering for myself I realized it was just too much food. As far as taste, having tried a few others in the area this is the best tasting in my opinion. Being in the area temporarily and being from the east coast, I wasn't used to the lack of Chinese restaurants here since we have them on almost every block back home lol. This one tasted the most like what I'm used to back home, and the few others I tried had food that wasn't even edible and I threw it out. As far as taste, it is a slight bit different but still very good, the sweet and sour chicken was tender and the breading not hard. The rice was good but a bit too much eggs used, but I could live with it. The dumplings and crab Rangoon were very good. Despite them serving a big amount and thinking I was going to waste most of it, In turn I found the food was really good still warmed up the next day. Tonight was my second time here and I ordered my second favorite plate, General Tso Chicken with pork fried rice. The chicken tasted good, again too much of an egg taste in the rice but it was good. Have some left over as I stated they give you single orders of everything and it is enough for about 3-4 people, the price reflects this as well.
