We were handed the menu and told to take as much time as we needed. The banh mi menu is really simple, there are only two options: a meat version and a vegetarian version. The spring roll options are the same. I was craving a banh mi so we went with their Butterfly Special (meat version). Of course I had seen pictures of the green pandan waffle and knew I had to try that too.\n\nThe total was $9.00 on the dot. It was $6 for the banh mi and $3 for the waffle. \n\nBanh mi came out presentably very nice. It was on a very pretty plate and then on a basket plate. It's the nicest banh mi I've ever seen. The banh mi itself was very flavorful. The bread was crisp on the outside and warm/fluffy on the inside. Whatever is in that banh mi is way better than any banh mi I've ever had. The only downside is that it is smaller than most banh mis. I probably could have consumed two of these!\n\nThe pandan waffle is delicious. It's not too sweet, and it was crisp on the outside and so soft on the inside. Some have already commented that it was doughy on the inside, and I agree that it is a bit on the doughier side. However, that's not to say that the batter is raw. It was just a fluffy, doughy kind of soft, which I actually liked. But then again, I love carbs of all kind. The pandan flavor is there without being overpowering or too subtle. Once again, it's not so sweet that it will give you a tummy ache. \n\nService is so kind here. The lady here came out and asked me if I wanted my waffle crispy or soft. I thought this was really nice of her because people have different preferences in terms of how they like their waffle cooked. She was really friendly, chatted with us, and gave us great service. :-)\n\nI wish the banh mis were bigger because they are so freaking good.

There are some slices pics of those items, but I'd def recommend they add it to their electronic board to boost sales. \n\nThey have 3 different types of drinks: Tea (all sweet as far as I can tell), snowbubble (smoothie), and milk tea. \n\nI got a tea with passion fruit, grape, and lychee with green apple jelly. It was good but very sweet. I couldn't finish the whole thing on my own and kinda wish they had an option to make it less sweet. But I'm also from the midwest so when I hear 'tea' sweet tea with syrup and flavors don't come to mind. To me, that's flavored soda/dessert, but I realize in South Bay the high fructose drinks are still considered 'tea'. Something I have to get used to.\n\nThe avocado snowbubble smoothie was good. It actually wasn't very sweet, which I appreciated, but it also wasn't super flavorful... then again, how much flavor can I expect from getting avocado. The weird thing about this drink was that I finished about half of it and had to go into an event. I came back 3+ hours later and it was still in the exact same condition. Not melted, still cold, not flat at all. Kinda makes me wonder what's in it that it doesn't melt down. At the end of the day I'd totally get this again in other flavors. \n\nI got the spring rolls with shrimp but no pork and was thinking they'd come in a to-go box as I was in a bit of a hurry but they served them in this beautiful basket and the portion was actually super generous. They weren't the greatest spring rolls ever and def could have used quite a bit more mint, basil, and cilantro for flavor but the presentation was lovely and it was unexpected for a little drink shop like this to even offer that so I'm a fan. \n\nThe woman behind the counter also made me a sample of their pandan waffle. It's green and tastes just like a regular waffle. I'm thankful she let me try it because I was curious but to me it might as well have been a waffle with green food coloring. Maybe when you order it you can choose toppings- I don't know and I didn't see it on the menu, but it wasn't something I'd get again on its own. Needed a light honey drizzle or dipping sauce in my opinion. \n\nI will say that it's not exactly fast and if you came while they were busy you could easily be there for 15 minutes waiting on your drink and more for a banh mi or spring rolls, but they're new so I'm sure it's something they're working on.", "name": "Butterfly", "rating": 4}, {"index": 17, "review": "Friendly staff, really clean restaurant with 5 small tables. \n\nThe menu is somewhat limited to two banh mi options of a special sandwich (multiple kinds of pork) and a vegetarian option for $6 each.

Also the cucumbers were cubed and not julienned which made it harder to eat in a sandwich. \n\nI also think the bread quality is an essential element to a good sandwich, which was definitely not the case here.

You could definitely taste the taro and honey dew.  The pearls were also the right consistently.  You are able to select sweetness as well.\n\nThe sandwiches weren't great so I would not order food again but would recommend their drinks.

This has become our favorite place to get Boba tea, locally.   Here's why:\n1) The owner, Jenny, is the nicest person in the world.   So friendly, and really goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and make sure you have a great experience.  The rest of the staff is also quite friendly.  \n2) The tea is delicious.  They use fresh fruit in all the drinks, and you can really, really taste the difference.\n3)  The Waffles are yummy, and so are the sandwiches.  Food is presented very nicely, too, in little baskets.\n4)   They make really beautiful, reasonably priced edible fruit arrangements which is all fresh, lovely, and delicious\n5)  The d\u00e9cor is cute and eclectic.

When I request to change to the real meat,they said that's all they have.They told me they make the meat. Seriously?? They made all the fake meats to put in their sandwich,horrible!! DO NO go to this store to pay for their fake sandwich. I wish I can put zero star to review it. I just leave the entire sandwich to them.

They had great non-vegetarian options; my friends got non veggie banh mi and a shrimp spring roll. Awesome spot with good seating, and the fruity drinks use fresh fruit.
