[{"index": 0, "review": "Came here for Dinner with a large group (around 30) and overall was impressed with the service and the food.  This was a corporate gathering and there was a fixed menu which was mainly salads, garlic bread and various pizzas.  \n\nWe took over a small section of the restaurant with 2 very long tables in parallel.  Once we were seated the staff quickly took drink orders and before we knew it, drinks and food started coming out.  \n\nFirst came the drinks and garlic bread, followed by the salads.  Salad was pretty standard and they had bleu cheese and balsalmic dressings.  I had a little of both, the balasamic was the winner.  The bleu cheese was somewhat flavorless.  \n\nAs we were munching, they started prepping for the pizzas to come  and soon enough they were bringing them out of the kitchen and putting them on elevated stands on the table.  There was a mix of cheese, margherita, veggie and others with meats.  I enjoyed the margherita and the cheese, they both had a lot of flavor.  Im not a big pizza guy, but this was some darn good pizza.  \n\nIn conclusion,  this restaurant really took care of us and we didnt have any issues.  The food we had was really good.  I hope one day I can come back and try other food from the menu.  The menu looked quite extensive and there was a lot of dishes I wanted to try.

It'd be a lot easier to downrate this if the food wasn't so satisfying.\n\nFiorillo's is an old family-owned-and-run Italian establishment in a somewhat out-of-the-way location not far from the airport boundary. They offer a banquet hall and have a bar area, but the large dining room is where most people flock to. My friend suggested this place after I pleaded indecision / willingness to try something new for the umpteenth time, so we stopped in for a weekday lunch.\n\nThe dining room was surprisingly busy, as noted by our server (one of the younger generation of the family), but it didn't seem to take too long to order or to receive the food. There was also a short delay for my Ballast Point Sculpin IPA ($8.50 for 16 oz draft), reportedly because the keg was old and had to be replaced with a new one. I've been on a beer kick motivated by west coast IPAs and the Sculpin is a prototypical example, with citrusy hops providing an expectedly enticing aroma. It's not very bitter unless you're taking large gulps. You could do a lot worse than the Sculpin.\n\nI thought that I might enjoy something on the heavier side and decided to go with one of my server's recommendations, the Guilianna's Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi ($26.95). He stated that it was a customer-favorite special which has been elevated to full-time menu status, and I can see why. The fish isn't dry, the red Bordelaise sauce is almost addictive (sweet but not too sweet), and the scallops, prawns, and mushrooms were all cooked properly and added to the medley of flavors and textures. The rice pilaf was also fun and the vegetables were fresh enough. The portion size overall is reasonable, not huge or small.\n\nThe complimentary bread w/ butter wasn't anything to write home about, but it helped to clear my palate between sips of beer. I also tasted my friend's Crab Bordelaise ($21.95), which had simple and fresh crab meat, more of a white Bordelaise sauce, and huge amounts of fettuccine. I definitely would've landed in a food coma if I'd had this.\n\nFiorillo's is a delicious if somewhat pricey restaurant, so I'm highly unlikely to go unless I'm invited.

Now if you're headed to this Italian inspired eatery, you definitely need to be aware of your surroundings because google maps will screw up the directions and lead you to the site opposite the establishment's actual location. Despite google maps misleading you, it really shouldn't matter because this eyesore of an establishment stands out like a guido at the gym. As soon as you walk in you are immediately hit with a feeling that screams \"Luxury Cheesecake Factory.\" This overwhelming feeling of nostalgia for the Cheesecake Factory comes with every dish at a very expensive price point. \n1. The Food\nThey say a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the restaurant business, it's normally not a good sign if your weakest link is your food. The equivalent of labeling Fiorillio's food as \"Italian\" would be calling the Shin Black instant ramen an \"authentic\" Korean dinner. Fiorillio's is able to hit a lot of the flavor notes of Italian cuisine, but ultimately it fails in its primary endeavor to provide clients with a taste of Italy. When you are seated, expect to receive a menu that when folded out has a wingspan only matched by the California Condor. Not to mention, the menu contains more words printed on it than most young adult youth fiction. \"Hey dumby, why are you playing the Hunger Games when there are plenty of dishes to order on the Fiorillio's menu to feed an entire district. We'll never go hungry again with this cornucopia of options.\" There, Suzanne Collins, I fixed your book. Anyway, after selecting the bruschetta starter and the Pasta Romano as the entre, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of my food. As expected, they brought the bruschetta out first. I give Fiorillio's an A+ for following traditional dining format where the appetizer comes out prior to the dinner. Now we go onto describing the bruschetta, which was probably some of the worst bruschetta's I've ever had. The variety of diced vegetables and fruits that sat atop the bread vessel looked like forlorn, damned spirits aboard Hades' barge being ferried across the river styx, expecting whatever fresh Hell awaits them for the remainder of eternity in the City of Dis. Upon biting into the bread, the eater realizes that the taste of the tomatoes and bell peppers is masked entirely by a pungent punch of garlic. Once you get through that, and apart from the occasional explosion of flavor brought by a caper, the only thing you'll taste will be the oil soaked bread. That bruschetta was so saturated with e-v-o-o, that per square inch there's more oil in that bread then there is in the entire Middle East. Fiorillio's is lucky that the U.S. Army hasn't tried to force a regime change and occupy their bruschetta. Fortunately for me, if that ever does happen I've already lost my disappointment of a son in the first invasion of Iraq. But don't worry friends, I thought something like this might happen and took out a massive life insurance policy on him. I'm rolling in more dough than the bruschetta is oil. Anyway, the main course was as equally disappointing as the bruschetta. While the dish is quite a sight to behold, much like a cheap Italian prostitute, the looks mask a much darker and unpleasant fate. From the instance I took my first bite, I could taste the first of three grave sins that an Italian restaurant can commit, domestic prosciutto. Now I know what your thinking, \"Harry, you're a 3 pack a day smoker and have been for the past 60 years, how do you still have the taste buds left to distinguish domestic from Prosciutto di Parma?\" To which I say, shut up and don't interrupt me during my educational review. I think that this is the best time to address the plague on American Italian cuisine that is domestic prosciutto. For those of you who don't know about prosciutto, prosciutto is delicacy made from pig haunch. The best and the only, as far as I'm concerned, prosciutto comes from a city in northern Italy called Parma. The reason why this prosciutto is so highly sought after is because they feed the pigs the whey of Parmigiana cheese, which causes the meat of the animal to acquire a subtle taste resembling that of the cheese. Upon slaughter, the succulent leg is then taken from the beast, rubbed with salt and aged between 9 - 18 months. The longer it ages the more the meat and fat will melt in your mouth. Prosciutto di Parma will first strike your pallet with a nutty flavor as the muscle breaks apart in your mouth, then as you begin to chew up the slice, the fat will start disintegrate, washing an unreplaceable sweet flavor over your taste buds. Then, through all of that, you'll still be able to detect a hint of delicious Parmigiana Reggiano that comes from the pig's whey diet. It truly is a magical experience...

Fiorillo's is located on the corner of El Camino with its own parking lot. Upon walking to the front entrance, we saw a gigantic group of people waiting outside. It turns out Fiorillo's hosts banquets as well, having a large hall to the left side of the building and a normal dining room to the right. \n\nWe were seated immediately upon arrival since there were plenty of tables open. The dining room is very spacious with large U-shaped booths and home-style, wooden tables. The color palette of the restaurant, however, gives it a very antiquated feeling that is in desperate need of an upgrade. While we didn't get our waiter's name, we were pleased with his service, as well as the other waiters who were quite attentive when it came to our drinks. \n\nMy hubby ordered the ravioli with sausage while I ordered the crab bordelaise. Complimentary garlic bread and regular house bread with sesame seeds were served first as appetizers. We loved how hot and fresh the house bread was, although considering the cold butter, it was good that the bread was steamy. I was fine with the garlic bread, but my hubby felt it was a little too heavy. \n\nAppearance wise, our entrees looked okay. The portions are certainly hearty, but the presentation was boring. While my hubby liked the ravioli itself, he wasn't too fond of the sausage, which wasn't cut into pieces but rather served as one, large link. The flavor of the meat wasn't memorable, giving off a strange after taste, and he would have liked the ravioli to be served in a larger plate since he didn't have room to cut each pasta square without spearing the others. \n\nAs for my crab pasta, I was disappointed with how watery the sauce was. Most of it sat at the bottom of the dish and didn't coat the pasta evenly. Therefore, some bites were much more flavorful than others. However, I could taste actual pieces of crab, so that was a plus. \n\nBy the end or our dinner, neither of us finished our entr\u00e9es and we didn't want to take the leftovers home. While the portions at Fiorillo's are large, the flavors are lackluster. So for the price, we can't say the food is worth it.

The gentleman who sat us was very nice and seemed to be part of the family business. The inside was very 80s diner-like. The menu had a huge selection and I couldn't decide between the two crab pastas. I asked our waitress for a recommendation between the two and said she thought they were both good but was biased towards the one with pesto in it. So I decided to give this one a try even though I had never had a pesto pasta with crab in it and thought it sounded like an interesting combination. Even though I ordered mine with less cream in it, it still was very heavy and overpowered the crab completely where you couldn't taste the crab.

I LOVE semifreddo and am always on the lookout for it when I try new Italian restaurants. I don't know many Italian restaurants that do. I often have it at Sapore in Burlingame. Well when my semifreddo came I thought the waitress must have accidentally given me an affogato because my dessert was served in a cup and was completely liquidy as if in an affogato, when the ice cream is melted and mixed in with the coffee. I asked my bf to check with the gentleman who sat us earlier and when he came by, he was defensive and said that this was in fact the semifreddo, had come up with the recipe himself and was sorry it wasn't what we expected. We didn't want to make a bigger fuss because my mom enjoyed her dinner and having us all together and that's all that mattered.

Maybe the dining room has better individual dishes, I don't know.  But what they served us at this work dinner banquet is an absolute insult to Italian food, and in fact, any kind of good food in general.\n\nLet's start with the appetizers.  These actually weren't bad.  But what did they serve?  Yakitori (chicken on a stick for those who don't know), crab hush puppies in cream pesto, and crostini with salsa on it.  Salsa, I kid you not.  Tomatoes and onions diced so that it even looked like salsa, or may have been taken from one of those plastic containers.  No basil, oregano, or any other seasoning that would make you think it was Italian.  And there is no trace of Italian in any of the other two appetizers.  NONE of these appetizers served appear anywhere on their regular menu.\n\nWhen dinner was ready to be served, the rolls they brought out were COLD...as in, refrigerator cold.  I started to pick one up and I could FEEL that it had been taken out of the refrigerator recently...or worse, perhaps thawed from being frozen.  And they served those individually wrapped butter bits...also hard and cold, with them, instead of whipping it for easy spreading like all good restaurants do.  I elected not to eat it.\n\nNext, the salad.  They gave us Caesar, and it wasn't too bad aside from being slightly overdressed.  At least the lettuce crunched and wasn't wilted.  But there is about the last positive thing I can say about the meal.\n\nWe got a three-piece ravioli next, and they, tasted as if they had been frozen, thawed, and heated in a microwave.  Unpleasantly chewy edges, with some of the inner cheese melted and some not, and the sauce didn't have anything special to it.  Not spiced well.\n\nThe main course was, to say the least, awful.  I'd signed up for \"steak with mushroom sauce.\"  What they actually gave me was the kind of beef you find in Asian stir fry, very thin, almost like a skirt steak, except it seemed like they had cooked it too long in a crock pot and literally drowned it in a mushroom-wine sauce so sweet it almost tasted like syrup, in addition to not having all the wine cooked out of it.  Stir-fry beef in too much sweet mushroom sauce...NO hint of Italian.  In fact, I was in such disbelief that I again checked their regular menu for this dish...and there is NOTHING on the menu remotely resembling what they served to me.\n\nThe mixed veggies they served along with the main course tasted like they'd come out of a frozen bag; the green beans were dark, mushy, and not at all fresh, and the broccoli also had a rather unpleasant taste.  They didn't even put salt on them.  And the potatoes...cooked well, at least, but zero seasoning, and I could also detect a hint of dirt left behind on the skin, like they hadn't been washed well before cooking.\n\nAdd to all this that the service of all the courses took so long that the schedule that my workplace presented us with...dinner at 8, work presentations at 9, champagne toast at 9:30, Dancing at 9:45, didn't happen.  Yes, they started the dinner service at 8.  But by 9:45, people had barely finished their main course, dessert had not yet shown up, and presentations had not yet started.  Because I work early in the morning I needed to sleep, I left before dessert started.  But based on my whole experience for the evening, I doubt I missed anything spectacular, at least food-wise.

In general, prompt, but there was a point where our waitress seemed to have forgotten the table's glasses of wine.\n\nFood:\n\nIf you're looking for real Italian food, I highly recommend you look for a different restaurant. This food is EXTREMELY Americanized. First of all, the menu. It attempts to be far reaching to the point of its own demise. Multiple seafood plates that seem similar in description, a lot of different red sauce pastas, etc. There's a lot of choices, but no meaningful variety. The salads seem questionable... Chinese chicken salad being one of the options. Ummm, okay then. I thought this was an Italian restaurant? In that same vein, there are multiple entree choices that have teriyaki sauce! What?? I ended up taking the steamed clam linguine served in a white clam sauce. More about that later...\n\n\"Bread\" service started with a salty, dense bread (?) with that cheap, powdered Parmesan sprinkled on top. Our waitress said it had a hint of cayenne. First of all, why would you put cayenne in the bread? And second of all, it didn't taste like cayenne anyway. Based on other reviews I'm guessing this is the garlic bread. However, it didn't taste like garlic. 5 minutes later we had a second bread service. What's that about? This was some generic bread you buy at a store. It had sesame seeds and poppy seeds on it... Not quite Italian (notice a trend?)\n\nWe didn't order any appetizers since nothing stood out as anything particularly tasty. Same with the salads, especially since I wasn't quite feeling the CHINESE chicken salad to go along with my ITALIAN clam linguine. Looking at other salads passing by, I'm glad I didn't order one. They seemed to have large slices of tomato and onion that would be suitable for a burger but not a salad.\n\nThe clam linguine was salty, and the \"white clam sauce\" that apparently (and should normally) be made with white wine didn't taste like wine. It also had cream in it, which is a big no no for such a sauce. Did I mention it was salty? Someone else at our table took the prawn diavolo (misspelled as \"diavlo\" on the menu)... The sauce was very watery and tasted as if it was made from powdered spices, not the real deal.\n\nWe skipped dessert for obvious reasons.\n\nSummary:\n\nOverall, this restaurant is overpriced for the lack of quality in the food. If you want something in the same price range (or even cheaper) but with better quality food, I'd suggest Macaroni Grill instead. \n\nIf you still feel the need to go here, expect a sub par American-Italian meal with a Chinese flair.", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 2}, {"index": 68, "review": "I came here for a holiday party with my company and we had an average experience.

Seafood Pasta Fiorillo (kinda Cioppino like over pasta, very good!). And another fave off menu special they always have is a Veal Chop in a teriyaki-mushroom glaze, it's awesome! Great pizza as well. My favorite marinara sauce anywhere is here! That says a lot. The warm bread served before dinner is great too! I have brought friends and family to dine here and everybody loves it. I do recommend going early (around 5pm or so) on weekends as they get busy. I have been going there for around 10 years at least 4 times a year or so and have never had any negative experiences. Though it can get a little pricy with drinks and appetizers, but it's not an everyday restaurant for all. I would consider it a nice place to celebrate a special occasion, or a nice date nite destination. Defiantly a good place for a family get together. They also have a banquet room for parties and special occasions.\nI highly recommend Fiorello's!", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 5}, {"index": 117, "review": "Our family is here no less than once a month.

But again, and again and again like every Italian restaurant in all of San Jose .... epic fail !!! So this is my first review of many and sorry to the trainee waitress, good kid,she tried.... Me and the mrs were wierded out when we first walked in to see the restaurant is one big room, like it's a cafeteria, \"PUT SOME DIVIDERS UP\" but we got a booth and we were happy about that.the food on the menu is described well and looks good.. The waitress came over and was very pleasant and profession and told us she was training and it was her 2nd day and she took our drink orders and returned with them and bread and had a great attitude.. So cudios to you trainee...Great job!! Then all of a sudden it went sooooo wrong!!! Our actual waitress came over and was way to over-bearing,loud, and creeped us right out she took our order and left... And then the food came out,for apps we got the mushrooms, crab cakes and fried raviolis to start mushrooms were blah,fried raviolis were frozen out of the box little pieces of over fried crap, and those poor burned crabcakes.. Just sad-face No words!!!! Now the entrees come out the mrs got the grilled salmon with ceasar salad and I got chicken parm with raviolis... The salad came out with this aweful smelling piece of salmon that the cook tried to mask by dumping a cup of garlic all over the salmon to try to mask that smell, but we both could see it and smell it!Shame on you guys!!! Now being from boston I got the very simple, chicken parm with raviolis.. The chicken parm was swimming in a huge casserole dish under a pound of marinara and a terrible gummy cheese. SO....I've excepted that most fake Italian restaurants will use frozen or boxed pastas and I'm cool with that. But what's up with this \" OUT OF THE CAN AND INTO THE PAN CRAP\" I came up with this term now for restaurants who use crappy pre-made sauces instead of having some integrity and honor and making ur own... And taking these sauces and pouring olive oil and garlic in them doesn't make them homemade either... GET SOME TOMATOES AND BEAUTIFUL FRESH HERBS AND MAKE UR OWN!!! And it's actually cheaper too.. And then in the middle of our meal we heard the loud ass mouth manager yell at this poor waitress across the room and was totally embarrassing her..

My boyfriend and I went there for a late night romantic dinner for Valentines day, our reservation was at 9:30 pm, but we arrived early at 9:20 pm and we were sat immediately.  The first person to greet us was a buss boy who asked us if we wanted waters,  we asked for water with lemon and about 4 minutes later received 2 waters no lemon.  We were finally greeted by our server about 7 minutes after being seated.  I have a special diet and asked for Angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and vegetables on it (pasta Primavera w/red sauce).  Someone came out to clarify what I could or could not eat and then we ordered.  My boyfriend had the ice tea and I ordered a wine, we got salads that looked like they had been sitting there ready to serve for a while, no offer for ground pepper even though we saw someone walking around with a pepper grinder.  The place was not by any means packed. The bar was empty, and people were slowly leaving as we sat there.  By 9:50 pm we had not received our drinks, and I had noticed that everyone around us had baskets of bread and we had none offered to us yet.  I asked the busser for bread,  he brought lemons and butter out and said that the bread was in the oven.  I then got up and asked for the manager, I let him know we had no bread served to us but the busser was getting it and that in 30 mins of sitting there we still had not received our drinks and we were already finished with our salads. He quickly brought out bread that was not by any means out of the oven, and said our entrees would be out in two minutes.  My boyfriend's ravioli with pesto came out fine.  My angel hair with marinara had no vegetables on it so they sent it back to the kitchen and came out later with a bunch of mixed vegetables on top of it that looked liked they came out of the microwave and tasted as such also.  I bit into one that was hot on the side but cold in the middle. So I moved them to another plate.  The dish was lackluster to say the least. I had a few bites and then pushed it aside.  \nWhen the bill came they charged over 20 dollars for angel hair and sauce with a crumby salad and in addition charged over 5 dollars for the crap vegetables they put on it. Instead of charging for angel hair they charged us for baked rigatoni. I asked the manager to take the vegetables off of the bill and he questioned if I had eaten them.  I explained how awful they were and that I had put them on my bread plate and if he had to ask he could ask his buss boy, which as he walked away with our bill I saw him do.  He did take the vegetables off,  but for sitting for 30 minutes without our drinks, and never being offered bread..  Which is an Italian restaurant standard..  There were no discounts or \"we took off the drink to apologize for your wait\", I've had better service at an Olive Garden.

The restaurant was very quiet when we were dining which was SO great, it gave us a chance to hear each other. Frankly, I like Fiorillo's better than Magianno's for a family meal because Fiorillo's is intimate and quiet, feels like a family business, and you don't get that \"conveyor belt\" feeling that I always get at bigger restaurants. At Fiorillo's we felt like we're not going to be told our table was given away or stuck in an awkward corner by the kitchen here... all the tables are well positioned. The food was rich but not overly heavy; the portions were great for the price and there was an option for every diner, even those of us who had finicky requirements like no meat or low salt. We had a Sangiovese with our lunch which was smooth and paired well with the meals. The caprese was AWESOME (and it's hard to say such a simple appetizer is amazing but it was, the sauce they used was fantastic). Also, the mushroom appetizer (Bordelaise?) was so good we ordered another plate!!  The favorite entrees were Chicken Saltimbocca, Veal Rollatini, and Ravioli Toscana (YUM).

The meatballs were delicious too. We will be back to try some of their mains. While walking out I saw some very delicious looking dishes on other patrons tables. The gentlemen I believe to be the owner walked from party to party greeting them sometimes staying to tell a story. Nice place that doesn't intimidate me anymore. Highly recommend and they might earn that fifth star once I get to try some entrees!!!", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 4}, {"index": 320, "review": "this place is a hidden little gem. i love it! the service was excellent. the staff was friendly and helpful. my dinner was scrumptious! the price was more than reasonable. i even got dessert which was fantabulous. i love this place and can't wait to go back. a great bang for your buck!", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 4}, {"index": 321, "review": "Ever have a hankering for some good red-sauce Italian? That's what brought me to Yelp in search of some good red sauce in the San Jose area. After a few deliberations, I decided on Fiorillo's.\n\nFirst, the service. My experience was quite at odds with some of the more negative reviews I've read here. I came on a Wednesday night around 6:45 and the parking lot was virtually full, yet the restaurant didn't seem to be very full. I was seated immediately by the hostess and my order was taken within a couple of minutes. My waitress was friendly and made sure that my water glass and bread basket were kept filled. She did the obligatory checkup a few minutes into my meal. The hostess was very friendly when I left. I have no complaints about the service, though maybe I was just lucky not to be there on a busy night.\n\nOn to the food. Usually in this type of restaurant, I skip the bread because it's nothing special - just empty calories. The bread here is really delicious -- crispy on the outside, piping hot inside, and covered with crunchy sesame seeds. The mixed salad is pretty standard -- iceberg lettuce, a couple of tomato slices, some sliced onion and mushrooms. Nothing to write home about, but the lettuce is nice and crunchy -- nothing wilted on the plate. Let's move on to the Veal Parmigiana. A behemoth casserole dish arrives piping hot -- better let it cool off for a couple of minutes. A nice layer of melted mozzarella covers some nicely breaded veal slices, bathed in a potent red sauce that I was strangely craving this evening. The sauce isn't what I would consider a top-notch marinara full of contrasting simmered vegetable flavors, yet it is somehow very satisfying with its concentrated and elemental tart tomato flavor balanced with a hint of sweetness. The dish is very tasty. The portion was so huge, I took half of it home. Onto the side dish -- overcooked penne pasta with more of the red sauce. For some reason, the sauce doesn't taste nearly as good over the pasta as it does over the veal -- go figure! I can do better at home with some boxed Barrilla pasta cooked al dente and a decent jar of marinara sauce.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't to die for, yet is acceptable. I did see (and hear) a few people who would have fit right in on \"The Sopranos\" or maybe \"My Cousin Vinnie\". There was one elderly woman diner who uttered \"s**t\" every other word. I guess that just comes with the territory.\n\nOverall a pretty decent experience. I'll come back again the next time I need a red sauce fix.", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 4}, {"index": 322, "review": "Hands down this is my favorite italian resturant to attend with my husband. We have been eating at Fiorillo's for three years now. We were first introduced to this place when we were searching for a banquet hall to host our wedding reception. Renee the banquet organizer is extremely nice, and made the wedding awesome, We had 100 guests and everyone enjoyed the food and service. Renee took care of everything. All I had to do was give her the stuff for the tables and tell her what I wanted and enjoy the wedding. We ordered the London Broil and Chicken Parm and everyone was very impressed. As far as the resturant goes. I do wish they were open on Sundays and Mondays, but they deserve a day off to spend with their family. I love the fact that it is family owned. Im not  a big fan of tomatoes but I have to say they have the best marinara sauce anywhere. Im always torn on the chicken parm or the jumbo shrimps stuffed with cheese and comes with angel hair pasta tossed in olive oil. Their bread is very yummy. It has sesame seeds and sunflower seeds in it. YUM!!! My husband loves their gnocci and for appetizers you must try their stuffed mushrooms. OMG ...they are so out of this world. I do agree service their is not the best for the prices you pay but the food is always great. Never any complaints there. I must warn you , you will feel out of place if you go in jeans...or maybe that is just me.", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 5}, {"index": 323, "review": "I have to say I was prepared not to like this place.  It really seems like a family-owned version of a chain restaurant when you walk in.  But then there's the food.  It's not Italian gourmet but if you're looking for well-prepared American-Italian comfort classics, you won't be disappointed.  The chicken parm was excellent and I had the veal picatta, which was extremely well prepared.  And the entree prices, around $15/plate, are very reasonable.  I will likely return.", "name": "Fiorillo's", "rating": 4}]
