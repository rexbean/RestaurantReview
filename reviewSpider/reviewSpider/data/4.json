This is my usual chinese take out to go spot when I'm commuting back home from work, and their food is very tasty.....HOWEVER, after today I probably will never go back to this place, and here are my reasons....\n\n1. When I first stepped into the establishment I immediately had to use the restroom (I am totally aware of the rule of restrooms only being available for customers,) which is why I told the woman in the front that I intended to order something, after I use the bathroom. This led to her giving me a dirty look, and assume I was just going to walk out based on the look/vibe she gave me.\n\n2. Her attitude was not friendly at all. She looked as if she just wanted to close the shop and get everyone out of the establishment. I understand that employees work long hours, and are tired etc. but that does not excuse your behavior to be rude to loyal customers such as myself.\n\n3. When finally paying for my food, I gave her a $20 bill. She looked at me with suspicion, and when I asked her what the problem was, she replied with \"is this real?\" I responded with, \"I'm pretty sure, since I got it from the Bank of America across the street\". She then tries to debunk it by holding it in the air and marking it with pens and all these other legitimacy methods. At this point she is still not convinced, and another woman comes out from the back and asks what the problem was. The woman then says something about it being a counterfeit bill, and the woman from the back grabs the bill and immediately says it's real. She then rings me up and gives me my change.

It's a local favorite for sure! Though that's certainly not because of the authentic Chinese food. ;) The main reason locals go here is because of the lightning speed with which you can get a HUGE load of cheap Chinese fast food. Anything fried is usually over-battered and over-cooked, so it's a little hard.\nBUT...the chow mein is usually pretty good. The curry chicken is very good, and I'm a fan of the bbq chicken. The soups are all good, too. \n \nFor all the foodies who like to complain...you pretty much know what you're getting by the second time you walk through the door, yet somehow the place is packed with return locals all the time. Go figure. The bottom line is that it's cheap, fast, decent Chinese fast food!", "name": "Ume Chinese Fast Food", "rating": 4}, {"index": 52, "review": "What more do you need?  Tasty food, good price.  At lunchtime, park on the street on Trimble or around back (it's actually closer).  The orange chicken is great and portions are large.

Last visit I tried their combination chow fun and it was okay, a little light on the meat and don't recall seeing any beef in it (there were 2 small shrimps).  Wouldn't order it again.

I've been to Orchid Thai and they're not the best in town...more like I'm desperate for some Thai food kind of thing.  But if you were expecting run of the mill Chinese and you get some Thai too that's definitely bonus to me.  Under $6 for 2 items (side and a main dish)...I got Pad See-Ew (less oilier and more flavorful than the restaurant next door) and grilled chicken on a stick (looked like ginger chicken...it was tasty and tender).

It is one of the first dishes in the fast food line and it looks so good yet tastes so crappy.  The pieces of chicken aren't cut in very uniform shapes so you have really huge pieces and really tiny pieces.
