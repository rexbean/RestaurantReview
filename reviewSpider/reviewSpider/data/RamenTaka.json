GREAT fried chicken!!", "name": "Ramen Taka", "rating": 5}, {"index": 702, "review": "had the tonkatsu ramen, pretty good flavored broth and stuffed with lots of meat, noodles and other goodies. my son had the lunch special with katsu ramen, good broth and a side of fried rice. rice wasn't really fried the way i'd had it before but tasted good side salad was typical with sweet mayo dressing. very friendly wait staff and attentive. that was a pretty big bowl of ramen for me and i knew i couldn't eat it all so asked to have them bag it so i could eat it later. also didn't see that there were some other items available that were written on a wall that i had my back to. had to get the octopus to go because i love it! very tasty too. only thing that's holding me back from giving them another star is having to pay extra for the container for my leftover ramen and for the octopus to go. never been charged extra for taking home leftovers but i guess it will probably be the norm soon.  i'd go back because even though it was lunch time it wasn't overly crowded, just a bit noisy but that's fine. clean restroom too. price was very, very reasonable and taste was excellent!", "name": "Ramen Taka", "rating": 4}]
