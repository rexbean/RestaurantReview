He brought it to the attention of the staff who quickly re-ordered his sandwich and gave him the incorrect one as well. He was pleased and enjoyed his. I took a bite and the turkey was amazing.

You see what he does to me? *sigh*\n\n3) Patrick Marleau--This is when I completely fell head over heels. One bite of Patrick Marleau and I was a goner. The meat, the avocado, the cheese--but it's the Dirty Sauce that really made it magical. I also like a man who is a little Dirty and Ike's Dirty Sauce is the BOMB. Patrick Marleau is the perfect balance of heat and savory.

I think it's a deceptive practice to add a surcharge and then tie it to the minimum wage increase and/or the support of their \"dedicated employees.  To be clear, I'm not questioning the employees dedication or their entitlement to a fair wage.  In fact I think $15/hr would be a better starting point than $11/hr.  What I'm saying is that wages and benefits are a part of doing business in Santa Clara and those expenses should be factored into the price of your product, regardless of what it is (sandwich or automobile).  I think it's an embarrassment to both the employee and the customer when a surcharge like this has to discussed.

I usually go to the one in Cupertino as it's closer to where I live but I was in the area so dropped by here for a late lunch.  So overall I like that Ike's caters more to veggie folk like myself and I appreciate that.  I have a couple of issues that if they changed I would raise my rating.  One is they don't really distinguish the vegetarian menu in terms of sandwiches that are vegan (meaning cheese and mayonnaise) and ones that are not. They don't really specify on the menu so you are relying on the staff to help you out.  Basically I kind of figured out that the dirty sauce has two versions and one is vegan.  The pesto and wasabi mayo are also not vegan.  They also add cheese to most of their sandwiches but they do have an alternate on some sandwiches so you have to ask. \n\nThe other issue is I think they make their sandwiches too simple.  The problem I have is if you remove even one of items in your pick you end up with a pretty plan Jane sandwich.  Case in point the Reading Rainbow sandwich has avocado, cheese, and pesto.  Make it vegan and it's avocado and maybe vegan cheese. Also although there seems to be tons of choices they really are mostly the same but intermixed slightly.  I'll give them credit for the cool names though:)  \n\nThey have only one sandwich with actually veggies and that is the \"sometimes I'm a vegetarian\".  That is usually my go to but it's pretty simple mix of artichoke hearts and mushrooms with dirty sauce.   The time I was here I had the meatless mikes on a gluten free bread.  I'm not GF but like to try the offerings and it was pretty disappointing.  Very dry in taste.  The meatballs were pretty good and they smother it with tomato sauce and vegan cheese.  It was ok.  The best part is when the meatballs ooze out when you try to eat it with the rock hard gf bread.\n\nSuggestion to Ikes.  One put more veggies in your sandwiches, maybe some sprouts, jalapenos more lettuce etc. Or more selections with avocado.   whatever you can do to fill up the sandwich and make it more filling and healthier.  Offer more alternate choices on sauces besides for just vegan dirty sauce.  Also does such a simple sandwich have to cost $14.00 with tip?

What a bummer.\n\nHollywould Cheesesteak on French bread w/ everything, banana peppers and red onions.  This was better than my sandwich, but still left no impression on us.

Let's just say we aren't eager to return.\n\nThe business appears to serve those with food restrictions which is a big perk. I had to look up what halal meant and why it was so important their customers had an array of both halal and non-halal options. They carry a line of kettle cooked chips with lots of standard and unique flavors for the crunch and sandwich combinations you crave. \n\nWe also noticed a 50 cent surcharge that was added to our bill. The explanation was fair. Some sandwich tax was in place and yadayada...but customers could ask for it to be removed? Not a big deal.\n\nAnyway, for the price I wasn't convinced that my taste buds had any connection to what I sampled.

Eisenhower\n\nI think by now everyone knows about Ike Shehadeh and his amazing sandwiches; he started in a little hole-in-the-wall shop in SF's castro district and eventually his popularity got so great that the neighbors had them evicted because of the crowds and circus that ensued. Now the sandwich shop with the kitschy d\u00e9cor and \u00b1200 oddly-named sammiches is 18 shops strong, and slowly taking the West Coast by storm--and for good reason. All it takes is one taste and you'll see why millions of folks will say that, \"I like Ike!\"\n\nMeat- Ike's is odd because most sandwiches will have a completely different name at every location, as they're usually dubbed after local celebrities and sports figures. However, they're all basically the same thing everywhere you go and if you order by number. Personally, I highly recommend using the Yelp app to order the sandwiches as it's so much less confusing than their menu. My personal favorites here are the #24 (Larisa O) Pastrami AND Bacon (What!?); #19 (Going Home for Thanksgiving) Turkey, Cranberry, Havarti and Sriracha to spice things up; and the #45 (Patrick Marleau) Roast Beef, Bacon, Horseradish, Sriracha and Jack!\n\nToppings- All of Ike's sandwiches come with just Lettuce, Tomato and their patented \"Dirty Sauce\"--which has been reputed to be made from Unicorn farts and Fairy Dust?! Actually, it's a Garlic Aioli with crack mixed in, but we'll just keep that between me and you... You can also choose to top your sammy with Mozz sticks and Onion Rings, but oddly enough they won't sell them to you on the side; what's up wit' dat???\n\nBread- Ike's Dutch Crunch is legendary and that's all you need to know. The other \"options\" are for rookies... Soft, chewy and just a little snap makes this my favorite Dutch Crunch of all-time.\n\nService & Ambiance- I typically try and avoid this location during the school year unless I can get there before 11:30 a.m. Otherwise be prepared to deal with massive lines, but the off-season and weekends are usually pretty chill. Service is always fast, friendly and efficient. Again, I'd recommend using the Yelp app to order, as it seems like they process online orders faster than in-store ones.\n\nValue- This is where Ike's gets dinged one star, as I still cringe every time I have to pay $11-12 just for a sandwich. If it wasn't so kick ass I'd have an issue, but their taste is almost unparalleled. To soften the blow their Yelp check-in offer for a free bag of chips is kinda hot. \n\nDelicious bread, fantastic meat and crack sauce makes Ike's one of my all-time favorite sandwiches.

I'd recommend adding a bag of chips to your order because they are so yummy (they do cost extra).\n\nBe warned that Ike's is always busy around the lunch and dinner hours.

Ike's carries one of my favorite types of chips, the Zapp's VooDoo chips. These chips are supposedly (a friend told me) a combination of all the seasoning on other chips.

They have really expanded though from their original and super busy location.  It is much easier to give them a try since they seem to be in a lot of places now.  When you enter this Ike's, you will see a huge blackboard listing all of their sandwiches and they have so many of them--popular cold sandwiches like Italian sandwiches as well as popular hot sandwiches like meatball subs.  Ike's offers many sandwiches that put a unique spin on classic sandwiches or flavor combinations.\n\nThere was almost too much choice.  There was so much I wanted to try and I was feeling that a somewhat light sandwich as well as one that would travel well would work best for me on this visit.  I ended up going with their Spiffy Tiffy--maybe because I felt it was light or maybe because it was just the first sandwich listed on the blackboard.  If I came back, I think I would probably try one of their more indulgent hot sandwiches instead like their cheesesteak or one of their fried chicken sandwiches (they have several of them).\n\nThe Spiffy Tiffy consisted of sliced chicken breast, avocado, mushrooms, pepper jack, provolone, pesto, lettuce, tomato, and onion.  The sandwich was served on Dutch Crunch bread.  The bread was good but lacked the freshness and difference between crust and interior bread of the Dutch Crunch bread I enjoyed in Napa Valley (Dean & Deluca).\n\nThe flavor of the sandwich was okay, but the fillings were all a tad soft and there was very little chicken.  The sandwich could have used more spice or seasoning too.  I should have opted for the jalapenos, which can be added at no additional charge.\n\nIn addition to sandwiches, Ike's features a wide variety of potato chips as well as some sides.  Desserts from Cake Monkey and Coolhaus (both Los Angeles area dessert shops) are available; with Cake Monkey, you get gourmet takes on nostalgic childhood treats like oatmeal cream pies while Coolhaus features ice cream sandwiches.

It would not typically be a sandwich that I would order.  But since I was getting the sandwich to go, I wanted something that would travel well.

Elvis Kieth - It's been a great while since I've had this sandwich, but I remember the teriyaki plus wasabi mayo combo to be strangely peculiar and tickling my fancy.\n\n5. Damon Bruce - An ungodly conoction whereby beer battered onion rings meets a Texadelphia cheesesteak. As good as it sounds.\n\n6. Change - I typically love ribeye and I typically love gouda, but both are curiously sub-optimal at Ike's. Also suffers from terrible naming rights.\n\n7. Patrick Marleau - Bacon and sriracha sounds like a power play combination, but I didn't score with this one.\n\n8. We're Just Friends - Like the Spiffy Tiffy, only with a strange orange glaze instead of delicious pesto.\n\nAfter writing this list, I realize I haven't sampled as many Ike's sandwiches as I should have, as I'm invariably disappointed anytime I order something that isn't the menage.

I feel that this sauce has a very heavy and assertive flavor and while delicious I think at times it can take away from the amazing combinations on the sandwich already.\n\nSpiffy Tiffy: Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone\n\nMy favorite out of the 2 sandwiches I tried. While the ingredients were familiar the combination was delicious! I loved the creaminess of the avocado and the dirty sauce juxtaposed with the pungent flavor of the pesto. The lettuce in this sandwich really helped because all the elements were soft and that extra texture really came through in the clutch. \n\nMenage a Trois: BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss\n\nThis was the sandwich featured on man vs. food and it sounded hella bomb then so I had to try it! I felt that the sandwich title is fitting because it was very messy and hard to control.

But my visit last night was so spectacular, I had to write a review.\n\nMy mom is visiting from out-of-town. Two things you need to know: 1) she's worked in the food service industry for over 20 years and is a stickler for food safety 2) she has a gluten allergy. A \"will get seriously ill\" allergy, not a \"on a fad diet, doesn't eat gluten\" thing.\n\nAfter she had been pointing out the lack of hairnets, gloves, and hand washing at other establishments we had visited...it was a breath of fresh air to see how wonderfully adherent to food safety standards Ike's is.\n\nFirst, when we ordered, she was asked if the reason for the gluten-free bread was \"allergy or preference.\" After being told it was allergy, we witnessed her sandwich being made on a dedicated station (no cross contamination!), by an employee who changed gloves and washed his hands before working on her food. They even went so far to wipe down the sauce bottle before handling it for her sandwich.\n\nSecond, we totally witnessed one of the workers clean up miscellaneous stuff around the main sandwich making table; napkins and wrappers that had fallen on the floor. I cringed as I watched her doing this, thinking to myself, \"wash your hands..wash your hands...\" To my relief, she did! It may sound weird, but I've actually had to point this out to people in food establishments before. Ever go to a Subway where the sandwich \"artist\" just finished handling some money, then immediately goes to making the next sandwich? Well, guess what, you're supposed to wash your hands before putting glove back on.\n\nThird, it was just nice to see everyone wearing a hairnet and gloves. I can't believe how few people I see wearing gloves.\n\nSo...the fact that Ike's is on the up-and-up with food safety and is really great with dealing with allergies--it's only the icing on the cake for how yummy and delicious their sandwiches are.

I have always gone out of my way to trek to Palo Alto and/or San Francisco for Ike's Place but because I want to support Ike and his establishments and because I won a VIP \"skip the line\" card at Ike's Lair in Santa Clara, I figured, what better way to commemorate my love for Ike's sandwiches than by visiting his new addition, picking up my card, eat a sandwich, and then writing a new review about my experience?  \n\nThis location reminds me of the one in San Francisco because the storefront is similar and parking is scarce.  I noticed that the people waiting anxiously for their sandwiches is what Ike's is about... I once waited 40 minutes for a sandwich (before Palo Alto opened). Someone before me ordered a little over $40 worth of sandwiches - it reminded me of my first visit at Ike's back in 2010 when I ordered $50 worth and it was for me, myself, and I.  In case you are wondering, I ordered the Kryptonite (like on Man vs. Food), Pride of Castro, and the Philly... \n\nI always try to order something different each time but the Matt Cain and Pizzle seems to be my all-time favorite.  I never get sick of it but for some reason 3 things jumped out at me- the Madison Bumgarner sandwich, the Gavin Newsom sandwich, and the Adam Richman sandwich.  I was thrilled to see Bumgarner's sandwich because Ike was talking about creating a sandwich during the NLCS and WS games... I smiled when I saw Newsom's sandwich because a) I think he is very handsome, b) did a great job as mayor of SF, and c) my kiddo's name is Gavin!  Even though I really wanted to order all 3 sandwiches... my love for Adam Richman (hence my blurb on my profile, \"Woman vs. Food\") won me over.  \n\nThe Adam Richman (BTW- he added me on FB.. his personal page!!!) is- fried chicken, ham, pesto, Swiss, honey, and avocado and of course I chose Dutch Crunch bread.  The only thing I omitted were tomatoes.  I waited about 5 minutes and I was in a trance w/ my sandwich after the first bite.  The chicken although fried was juicy and tender... the ham goes w/ almost everything, I'm a cheese person so Swiss did not and will never bother me, and the pesto and honey made the sandwich come together like the sandwich was named after my idol and made specifically for me.  I wanted to eat 1/2 of it, I really did but I couldn't resist so I ate the entire thing causing the patrons waiting and eating to laugh at me... \n\nService was impeccable.  I was given my VIP card w/ a smile and the girl that took my order told me what was popular.  I don't know why but I ask what is popular almost always just to test the employees.

That same girl that took my order came and offered me an actual piece of bread or anything for him.  I declined but thanked her - you can't get more personable than that!

Plenty of toppings, too, especially avocado. Would try again on sourdough and/or with the fried chicken instead of halaal, just to see how it changes the flavor.\n\nThe Menage wasn't as good to either of us, partly because the sandwich itself was so sweet that the dutch crunch bread didn't really work well with it.

Forget Togo's and little sandwich shops, Ike's is better!", "name": "Ike's Love and Sandwiches", "rating": 4}, {"index": 459, "review": "I'm torn between 4 stars and 3, so let's call it 3 1/2 stars, but you should know upfront that this was my first visit and I would definitely go back to try some of their other sandwiches.\n\nThere are some really great things about this place: the service is good, very nice people working there, the business provides benefits, healthcare, and sick leave to their employees, which I really respect and appreciate, and the ingredients and sandwiches are very creative.  I do wish they would sell their fried goodies (fries, mozzarella sticks, jalape\u00f1o popper, zucchini) as sides, though...\n\nSo why the 3-star review? Let me start by saying I am very particular about my sandwiches.  Don't laugh, because I know the second (and most important) requirement sounds so OCD, but for me a good sandwich must 1) have a good amount of mayo or whatever the \"wet\" element of the sandwich is and 2)  it must have an even distribution of toppings - I want to taste everything in every bite (seriously, I'm neurotic about this - example: I open up my burritos before eating them to mix the fillings with a fork so there is sour cream, etc in every bite). So if you're not as obsessive as me, you could probably consider this a 5 star sandwich place.\n\nSo...I ordered the Bear Hug (rib eye, mushrooms, bacon, jalape\u00f1o poppers, extra dirty sauce).  The meat was amazing and the bacon covered pretty much the whole sandwich (score!).  The Dutch crunch bread was delicious.  Now, since the sandwich comes with extra dirty sauce I didn't think it necessary to order it with more extra sauce but I definitely should have because it was super dry (pet peeve #1) and I couldn't really taste their apparently famous dirty sauce.  And, much to my chagrin, there were only a few small jalape\u00f1o poppers on the sandwich so a lot of my bites had no poppers in them (pet peeve #2).  Strangely, the mushrooms were raw and some of them pretty thickly sliced, so I wasn't really a fan of that element.  That's probably my fault - I should have asked if they were saut\u00e9ed but I just assumed.  To top it off, I ordered my sandwich with extra cheese but if they put it on I couldn't see it or taste it...I'm pretty sure they forgot.  I doctored up my sandwich with some ranch, caramelized onions, and melted cheese when I got home and it was yummy.  (And just in case you are on the edge of your seat wondering, yes, I did pick off the mushrooms, saut\u00e9 them, and put them back on the sandwich. I TOLD you I was neurotic.).  Next time I will for sure order like my usual super picky self so I'll get the sandwich exactly like I want it.\n\nAnyway, as I said, I would go back for more.

Either way, its a plus in my opinion. \n\nI came here with a girlfriend who is allergic to gluten. She had visited Ikes the day before and was obsessed with their gluten free bread. We both ordered the Jim Rome; hers ,of course, with gluten free bread and mine with dutch crunch. After sitting down to wait an employee (I'm assuming a manager) approached her and told her that unfortunately they hadn't received their daily deliver of gluten free bread. What would have been a total bummer was turned into a really great experience because he offered to turn her sandwich into a salad, refund her money and offer her a free sandwich the next time she came in too. WHAT SERVICE! The poor guy had them cut all of the items up into salad toppings and brought it over to her in a plastic produce box. Obviously this place doesn't make salad but the guy really put work into make sure she was happy. He even said she could just take the box if we weren't planning on eating there. We decided to just stay and eat there since the poor guy went through so much trouble. The guy who rang her up also came by and apologized to her. She decided not to take the refund seeing as how they went through so much trouble and she still got what she wanted, sans bread. \n\nAnother thing that happened that made me really impressed with the service was that when they called my name out when my sandwich was ready, the guy messed up my name. This happens pretty much anywhere I go that takes my name but the guy offered to buy me a drink to make up for messing up my name. ADORABLE. \n\nThe sandwiches themselves were amazing.

People bottle-neck in front of the cashier trying to read and they awkwardly send you passed to order, which makes a huge crowd about all the tables while people are picking lettuce off their faces trying to privately chat.  The whole scenes makes everyone feel awkward and a little tense. Combine that with a less than optimal sandwich assembly line-- you get a lot of sourpuss faces waiting to get their delectable sandwich and run out of the place.
