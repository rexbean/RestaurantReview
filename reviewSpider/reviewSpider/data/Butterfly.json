[{"index": 81, "review": "Heard this place opened up near campus so I was excited to check it out and it did not disappoint. Super convenient location and totally worth the price. The staff is very friendly and the place itself has a cute & comfortable vibe. My friend and I got the boba and the meat & vegetarian banh mi and they were really good! boba was a bit sweet for me but other than that a new go-to spot", "name": "Butterfly", "rating": 4}, {"index": 82, "review": "This is the best place for Bubble Tea , Juices and Smoothies .
