The host at the front put us on a wait so we grabbed a drink at the bar. We then we're called for our table so we closed out at the bar. \n\nOnce we were seated our server got to our table in a timely manner but didn't greet us with a smile. She said her name was Pomaikai. She didn't name any specific beverages or offer to even bring us waters, as we were drinking alcoholic beverages so that's the first thing you should do. She did ask us if it was our first time dinning there and we said no, but that the other couple who were meeting us where. She told us the new items on the menu but was not enthusiastic. She didn't not seem excited what so ever towards us or her other tables as we could see. I then flagged her down and told her that my fianc\u00e9 did not like the Manhattan that he ordered from the bar and asked if the could make another drink instead. She said sure what would you like he ordered and old fashion instead this time and when it returned to the table she asked him to try it, you could tell on my fianc\u00e9 face that he still did not like it but then stated it was fine, she then said okay and walked away.

Then she came back to tell us that the food would come out at the same time. So I then told her that he would prefer the ribs because that's what he originally wanted but you walked away before he could even order. We thought that if she was going to at least make sure it came out at the same time then why not order the ribs.

It's effing packed, too. But it's first come, first serve. We stand by a tv and reluctantly an elderly couple left after 10 minutes of us standing. I had looked on their website for the types of drinks they have and found the Honey Honey Blonde to be best suited for me, and I was right (it is a very light tasting beer, lighter than a Corona). The hubs tried the Gulden Draak, which is very dark since it is at a 10.5%! Anywho, we ordered something that wouldn't be too messy since we're at the bar (and when you're stoned it feels like everyone is watching you lol).

It makes sense, they are a large restaurant and wouldn't want anything to jeopardize their business. They are famous for their half-yard beer glasses, which I guess is where the name comes from... But back to the truffle fries. They are regular skinny fries with an oregano/parmesan/truffle topping. NOT unlike the truffle fries at Alexander's... now THOSE are truffle fries. We even asked for more truffle on our to-go order and it was still sh*tty. It's affordable american fusion cuisine so what do you expect for $4. As we're finished with our meal, our pager goes off.

I'd suggest calling into this place before you go to find out the wait time and make a reservation so you don't waste your time.\n\nThe servers were nice and attentive to our needs which was a good plus.\n\nFor an appetizer, I tried out their calamari. It was pretty average, but the sauce was the hero which made it a good dish.\n\nFor the entree, I had a tasty Firestone Double Barrel Ale and an extremely delicious Bearnaise Grilled Burger. My burger was cooked perfectly medium just as I liked it and the tiny fried onions provided a nice, subtle crunch. It was good that the bearnaise sauce was on the side so that I could control how much sauce I would throw onto my burger. The sauce was well made, but I would've liked a little bit more than I had. The fries were also cooked perfectly and complimented well with the burger, as expected.\n\nOverall the environment was nice, it seemed like Yard House was the perfect place to hang out with a few friends, even a lot of friends, or even bring someone on a date to.

They open at 11:00.  When my husband and I arrived through the door, there were 4 employees at the host table.  We were greeted a \"hello.\"  But were not helped, we just stood there.

We decided on the fried clamari as our starter. Thank you god we got a nice server. When he came back with our drinks we were ready to order. My mom got the FIsh &Chips and I got the Garlic Lobster Noodles ( I wanted to see what all the rave was about). \n\nFried Calamari- The fried calamari was pretty good. It wasn't oily at all, and the two dipping sauces they gave you really helped enhance the flavors. We got two different kind of sauces, tarter sauce and I believe mozarella sauce. Either way the calmari tasted good and even better when I dipped it in both the tarter sauce and mozarella sauce. I didn't really notice it was oily until I got to the bottom of the basket, but even when I reached the end there was only a small amount of oil.\n\nFish &Chips- I don't know if my mom really enjoyed the Fish &Chips. While she said it was good she only ate 1/4 of the fishes they gave on the platter. The fries they gave with her fish were out of this world  they gave her a lot of fries and I kept picking off her plate because it was so good. Okay,back to the FIsh.. I got to taste the fish and I thought while the fish was good, the batter on the out side was to thick. I would really prefer it with less of the batter.\n\nGarlic Lobster Noodles- I wanted to see what all the rave about these garlic lobster noodles were about. This plate was pretty good, I don't know if its good to a point where I would get it again, but it was pretty good. I loved the shrimp and the lobster on this plate. My personal perference of the noodles were that they were seasoned why to much. My mom really really really liked my dish, I couldn't finish it after eating only half and she finished it for me.

She said she buzzed me 25 minutes ago.  However, my buzzer never went off or lit up once.  She told us since we were outside that's why it didn't buzz...why weren't we warned?

I know that Friday nights are usually very busy for restaurants so we wouldn't be seated right away, but compound that fact with a newly opened restaurant and the wait time will easily double or triple.. This place is kind of chaotic because there were 20 people waiting inside by the entrance, another handful of people waiting outside the entrance, and large groups of people waiting downstairs in the main dining room by the bar watching the Warriors game on one of many TVs that they offer.. They have an awkward table right by the entrance that seats about 10 people, and the reason it could get weird is because you have the people still waiting for tables within an inch or two of you while you're eating.. The same story goes for the raised tables that surround the bar.. We had drunk and eager Warriors fans resting their drinks or their arms on our table while we were eating.. Something positive about this place is the impressive number and display of their TVs though.. They are all positioned very strategically so that everyone gets a great view, and they have about 3 or 4 different programs on (mainly sports) so guests can choose which they would rather watch no matter where they're sitting..\n\nNow on to the food.. We had the calamari as an appetizer and between the 2 of us we weren't able to finish it all but it was very tasty!

My salad had a very very strong flavor profile, so strong in fact that the ingredients seemed like they were fighting each other for attention.. I'm not sure what it was but it was overwhelming and difficult to enjoy.. I think this salad would have been much better if the flavors were a little more subtle.. The seared ahi was overly seasoned and I had to cut off the seared parts because they put so much pepper on it.. The strong taste of the pepper rind combined with the competing flavors in my salad were just unbearable..

Both visits were in the afternoon between lunch and dinner to avoid the huddled masses yearning to be paged to their table. Parking was easy. When you arrive, a smiling host escorts you to a table. The entrance overlooks the bar and lower dining room area. All areas are stroller- and wheelchair-accessible. The acoustics were good during my visit and the place looks like it could get loud when busy. The ceiling is a wad of shadowy fire sprinkler plumbing, duct work, speakers, and Unistrut. There is a scattered array of televisions.\n\nAt the bar on the first visit, there was a good looking male+female couple, each with a jumbo, turbine-engine-case-shaped beer glass. The woman wore a tank top, khaki shorts, and a just-back-from-Burning-Man tan. Not that I was looking. (Lucky couple.) \"What do you call those drinks?\" I asked my server. \"A Yard,\" she answered. Imagine a tall glass with a capacity two point five time your bladder's. They drank two each. Their immediate future would include peeing and giggling. If I were not driving, a Yard would've been on my tab. I wonder, \"How the heck do you shoehorn those glasses into the dish machine?\" \n\nThe menu has a wide variety including vegetarian items and some items identified as under 600 calories. Most menu items have neither of these markings. On my first visit, I tried the ginger-crusted Norwegian salmon with garlic mashed potatoes, (US$27). Order this and I think you'll be pleased. Next visit, I opted for the Cuban Pork Dip sandwich, (US$14). It's made with crispy, thin Cuban bread. I wanted to try this baked product once even though authentic Cuban bread is usually made with lard. The sandwich arrived with pencil-thin french fries fanned out like an agave in a paper-lined, stainless steel cup.

However, some of the food I've eaten here was unsatisfying.  The menu seems to rely significantly on canned and frozen ingredients.  Last week I made the mistake of ordering the margherita pizza.  It featured uber-salty canned tomatoes, tasteless basil strips, and pale, bland crust.  I guess I shouldn't expect much from a chain restaurant, but I hoped for higher food quality in exchange for the relatively high prices... I was wrong.  A plus is that the menu is extensive and caters to diverse tastes.\n\nSERVICE (pretty good)\nGenerally, I have had satisfactory customer service at Yard House.  Hostesses seem to be remarkably efficient in handling waits.  In my experiences, servers were fast, even when the place was packed.  My experiences at the bar have not been as positive.  I have found the bar staff to be less attentive and less friendly than the staff as a whole.  I once had a memorably negative experience when I was intentionally ignored by a bartender.\n\nATMOSPHERE: (good)\nThe layout and atmoshpere make Yard House a fun place to be.  Over-sized tables and chairs are comfortable.  I do wish the televisions were bigger; they aren't proportionate to the enormous room.  I often have difficulty reading text on the televisions.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS NEGATIVES:\nOften there are long waits to eat at Yard House; waits can exceed an hour.  Even seats in the bar area can be hard to come by.\n\nI have experienced lines for the restroom that rival those you would find at a sporting event -- no joke.  The men's restroom has 2 or 3 toilets and 2 urinals.  I think this is insufficient for a beer/wine/liquor establishment with a capacity of over 500.  To me, one of the benefits of suburban chain restaurants should be their ample restroom facilities.\n\nYard House serves 24-ounce beers in 3-foot tall bongs they call \"half-yards.\"  The use of these half-yards as drinking vessels is a gratuitous spectacle that I don't appreciate.  The half-yard is difficult to drink (one practically has to take it off the table and put it in his lap to sip).\n\nApparently, management has adopted a practice of showing every available sporting event and not changing channels even when there is substantial interest in a particular event.  I discovered this recently when I was at Yard House when a Raiders game was being aired.  My group and a whole lot of other Raiders fans were in a section where the televisions were showing Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Buffalo Bills (or some equally inconsequential game).  According to the waitress, patrons are encouraged to tell the hostess that they are interested in a particular event, and the hostess will seat them in areas where that game is being shown... if not,  you run the risk of sitting in the  section where the loser bowl is being played.  Why does Yard House even play uncompelling games with non-local and low-market teams? To me, Yard House's TV practices are annoying and defy common sense.", "name": "Yard House", "rating": 3}, {"index": 1789, "review": "I freakn love this place! and I don't love much of anything anymore. \n\nThe biggest beer selection on the planet.

From the reviews, it seemed like this was a pretty popular place and actually hard to get in, but we were lucky and it was a bad weather weekend where no one wanted to go out to the bars. Since it was past 10 pm, they had us get wristbands to get drinks at the bar, which was no big deal, and we got in just like that even though we had a pretty big group (6 people).\n\nIt was semi-crowded inside (maybe about 80% full), but lots of people were already on their way out. This place has a crazy awesome selection of beer. TONS of beer on tap. From domestic to imports, this place has something for every beer lover (and even some cocktails for the non-beer drinker). As I said in another review, I'm not a huge beer person, but I can appreciate the finer beers (aka not the Natty Light/Budweiser types).\n\nMy friend picked up a Firestones Ale, while I tried one of their specialty lambics, the Tellermans Framboise (they had strawberry ones too which his cousin's sister got). My friend's cousin got a pear cider, while her fiancee picked a Leffe Blonde. We all seemed to like our drinks (and there are definitely non-beer drinkers in our group). After wandering for a while (tons of people had the half yard, which is basically this huge glass that is half a yard long), we decided we would sit down at a table and chill for a bit.\n\nIt wasn't too difficult to get a table at all. After sitting down, we decided to order some food and ended up deciding on some chicken tenders, their truffle fries, and some calamari. The food came relatively quickly and it all looked pretty reasonable. There were maybe four chicken tenders, which we all shared, which came on top of a generous serving of thin cut pencil fries (which were really done well). The truffle fries were tasty and fried perfectly and covered with Parmesan shavings and herbs (some of the best I've had). The calamari was well... calamari. Nothing special, but nothing awful either.\n\nHad a great time here; the only thing that we had a gripe about was the fact the waitress kept coming to our table and asking us if we wanted to order more drinks/food (like every 10 minutes).

However with everything that happened, I guess the 2 stars is deserved.\n\nIt started out with a phenomenon that I have noticed at almost every Yardhouse I go to, my first beer choice was not available.  (My beer had to wait for a keg to be tapped which apparently takes 25 minutes in Yardhouse time, the beer my girlfriend wanted was just plain out.)  But since there are so many beers we just selected another.\n\nWe ordered the garlic mushroom noodles which while pretty tasty, was definitely nothing special.  We also ordered a beer sampler which I always enjoy.  I have drank most of the beers that they serve there, but my girlfriend hasn't enjoyed nearly as many, so it was really nice to be able to get 6 little samples for her to try.  (And she ended up finding one that she really loved!)\n\nThe first indication that we might have a problem was that the wait staff had a bit of confusion as to who was going to wait on our table.  The first guy came by and introduced himself, but then another guy came by and said he would actually be waiting on us.  He ended up seeming pretty disinterested in what was going on, and didn't seem to be very familiar with the beer menu.

Sadly however they completely mangled the dish and ended up way overcooking it, and then drenching it in soy sauce.\n\nTo top it off our waiter didn't bring us any condiments or even ask if we wanted some.

I guess 1hr is 3hrs to them. BLAH! if it wasn't for a friends bday I wouldn't even bother. we didn't have a large party, just a medium party of people. It was very irritating for them to keep telling us the reason why it's long is because they are waiting on a large table. well a large booth could've fit all of us if you didn't decide to let 2 or 3 friggin people sit there when you can easily fit 6.

What other reason do you have to come here? Seriously?\n\nI've tried about a dozen of the beers. I can't remember them all by name but what's the point? Im not done trying them all.. And well if I saw the menu, I know which beer I last tried. \n\nI love their brown ale, rogue hazelnut brown nectar! I recommend you to try it if you like dark beers and hazelnut. \n\nAnother one of my favorite beers is a blended beer, eclipse. It's a combination of blue moon and guiness stout. It looks pretty cool in a half yard, there's one distinct layer of blue moon and another layer of guiness, but when you drink it you get the mix of both. \n\nFruity beers aren't on the top of my list but there are a few good ones and I've tried a lot of them because... my friend's like them a lot.\n\n-The Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry is delicious, they usually run out of this. Taste like blue moon with blueberries.\n\n-Another one that is quite popular is Timmerman's Strawberry that taste like strawberry cider. They won't serve this to you in the half yard because it has a higher alcohol content. \n\n-Lost Coast Apricot wheat, it taste like a sweet wheat with light hints of apricot. \n\n-If you like floats you should try lindeman's framboise\nwith vanilla ice cream. Taste like raspberry soda float and it will get you buzzed. \n\n-My favorite fruity beer is probably going to be Rose Gaarden, it's a blended beer that combines hoegaarden white and lindeman's framboise. Everyone think's it taste like a fruity pebble beer. \n\nTheir food is usually too salty for me. I do love that they have a whole vegetarian/vegan section. I have my days where I like to eat vegetarian. \n\n-Shrimp ceviche spoons are one of the few things I like to snack on here, fresh and zesty.Small portion enough for just one person.\n\n-Seared Ahi Sashimi was a disappointment compared to the one I tried in Vegas. It was way too salty and the texture was really dry all of the times I ordered it.\n\n-Chinese garlic noodles are good but over salted. I usually share this, it  is made with thin noodles, shitake mushrooms, garlic, parmesan cheese, and oil. \n\n-Onion ring towers are a must, they're probably the only things on the appetizer menu that is made without excess salt.\n\n-Blue crab cakes can be skipped. They don't use fresh blue crab and it taste more like a croquette than a creamy crab cake. \n\n-If you order the california roll, it's probably something you aren't expecting. It's a single california roll blown up to the size of your fist. If you really like california rolls, you'll like this. It can get bland and gross after a while. Ask for sriracha if you like spicy\n\n-Hawaiian poke stack is okay, generic poke stack. It's a deal during happy hour.\n\n- The classic ranch appetizer salad is probably my favorite salad to get. The classic ranch salad has the whole shabang, not just iceberg lettuce and ranch dressing. Who drinks beer and eats salad? ME! It helps rehydrate me after drinking all those beers.\n\n-Veggie truffle oil mac and cheese. THUMBS UP! Rich cheesy goodness with fragrance of truffle oil, topped with bread crumbs. Share this, you won't be able to finish it. Oh and don't forget a beer. It's a heavy dish.\n\n-Veggie boneless wings are really good to snack on. It taste like the real thing. I swear. I get buffalo sauce and it's kind of salty but that's okay if I have an ice cold beer by my side.\n\n-Ahi sliders are very interesting and a must try. I felt like it was a bit salty, like everything else on their menu but the sliders were still tasty. When I took my first bite, I got a big burst of the juicy tomato and ahi tuna. It was so good, but when I got to my third one I was full. They come with a side of shoe string fries.\n\nSorry for the long review, I've been here way too many times. Since I've been here so often, I concluded that their hospitality is outstanding but the waiter always goes on a long haitus. No matter what server you get.

Apparently our server charged the entire bill on my card when it was supposed to be a split check. Didn't really make sense because I signed for $30 including a cash tip so it was kinda sketchy that he charged the whole bill on my card afterwards. Kind of makes me wonder what would have happened if I didn't catch this \"mistake\".

As we knew the portions were going to be big sharing these items was just right. The steak came with mashed potatoes that looked like it was slightly baked (it had a browning/slight crisp to it like it was put in the oven). with a side of green beans. Overall a good dish. The cheesecake was topped with nuts and whipped cream with the caramel and raspberry sauce, also a good combo that you can't really go wrong with. Again, it was nice for sharing.  \n\nWhat the other couple ordered (which I also tried): mini Pork Belly taco and mini kimchi taco (both very delicious - and you can't really taste the kimchi if you're a phobia of kimchi like my fiance is). \n\nMy fiance also ordered one of their tall glasses of beer.

Yes, yes, I know that not including the chain's own namesake in my review may be a sin, but it seems the overwhelming amount of yelpers who've already chimed in about the amazing beer selection can clue you in.\n\nThe setting: Wednesday, Santana Row, warm summer night.\nOccasion? Birthday dinner on the row.\n\nWe arrived at 6:30 p.m., and even for a weeknight, the wait was out the door (although there isn't much waiting room inside anyway).  We were seated within 30 min., which was pretty decent taking into account the massive hype.  Also, waiting in Santana Row isn't that bad with so many shops and hangouts to kill time with.  \n\nInitial Vibe\n--------------\nMe and seven other dinner guests were seated on the mezzanine level of the restaurant which, while still considerable noisy, was less noisy than the lower level where the bar is.  We met our waiter, who was amiable enough.\n\nStarters and Something Yummy\n-------------------------------------------\nTo start, we ordered the chicken nachos and the firecracker wings.  While the portion of the nachos was pretty huge, the flavor and uniqueness was pretty lackluster, something almost reminiscent of drunken late-night home-made nachos.  The firecracker wings, on the other hand, were amazing.  The order came with 8 crunchy and tasty wings on a bed of red cabbage, which I really could have done without.\n\nMain Course and Big Confusion\n--------------------------------------------\nWe moved on to entrees.  Here's where things started to get dicey.  We were greeted by a new waitress who would be taking over while our waiter was on break.  Also, friendly enough.  I ordered the bearnaise burger and subbed the fries for sweet potato fries for a little extra.  Overall, the portion was good and the burger was cooked to pretty nice medium rare.  However, although I received my food, I couldn't say the same for some others at the table.  Amid some confusion from our table, our waiters, and the kitchen staff, four of our dishes had been lost, only one of which finally made its way to the table.\n\nSo count it -- 3 dishes missing.  We alerted a waitstaff, who let us know she would alarm our waiter/ermm waitress, or whoever it was that was waiting our table.  When we didn't get a response for about 10 minutes, we tracked down another waitstaff.  Our original waiter came to our table to let us know that he had heard that all of our food actually did arrive and that we are all taken care of and dandy.  Not the case.  Another seven-ish minutes pass by and we're told that our food, although made, was left in the kitchen because of a lost order ticket.  Out comes the manager to ask if we'd like those dishes remade.  But it's now 8:30, an hour and a half since we first sat down.  No, we don't want those dishes anymore.  \n\nDessert and a tart aftertaste\n-------------------------------------\nHowever, we are comp'ed with free desserts for each guest at the table, minus the birthday girl, who's already accounted for.  I share the sampler with a buddy (not that exciting) but really like the fresh-baked brownie with a scoop of ice cream.  Imagine a brownie pizookie, if you're familiar with BJ's: same tin-dish, same layout.  Our waiters are pretty intrusive now after the case of the missing dishes, checking in about every 5 minutes.  We try giving the hint that we'd like some privacy, but alas, our attempts continuously fail.  I dislike an absent waiter, but an intrusive waiter upsets me even more, repeatedly killing the vibe, conversation, and merriment of the table.\n\nIn the end, we spent a good 3 hours at Yard House and save for a few gems in the menu, the overall experience left me with a bitter aftertaste.  The food was a solid 3 with a few hit and misses, but the service left a lot to be desired.

There's even a vegetarian section. \n\nIt took me forever to pick something from the menu. Did I want beef? Pasta? Seafood? I was dizzy from reading everything.

I dipped everything on the plate with it: mashed potatoes, fish and bok choy. And I'm not usually a fan of beer but this strawberry beer tasted more like a cider than anything else.

Yolanda was our bartender and she gave us a few samples of different beers to try. I personally like Blue Moon, so she ran with that and found me a beer that I absolutely loved. I only wish I could remember what it was called! It had a nice apricot taste to it and was similar in color to the Blue Moon.

We ordered our drinks and waited.. waited for the last person to arrive. \nOnce everyone arrived and we were seated, I noticed that my friend who had just arrived didn't have anything to drink.

The reason why I only took time to write this review is because of my steak. I knew it was a mistake not going to LB Steak, but the steak was in a condition that was alarming. I believe that at least one fourth, or even one third of the steak, was pure fat; the type of fat that people use to grease the grill/pan when they start cooking their steak. I called the waiter and he acknowledged the fact that it was indeed too much fat for a steak, but some guy who I assume is the manager or someone of a higher rank came over and this was the conversation we had:\nme: \"I believe this steak has too much fat.\"\nhim: \"Well, that's called marbling.\"\nme: \"..I know but I wasn't expecting this much\" (pure lumps of fat and marbling is different)\nhim: \"Maybe if you didn't want the fat you should have ordered the filet\"\nI think it is safe to say I know what a proper steak should be. Having a peculiar diet, I think it is safe to say that my diet is almost the opposite of that of a vegan's, mainly eating every meal with some type of meat (mostly unprocessed meat). I know that that wasn't marbling but it was fat.

The burger comes standard with a side dish and I opted with the standard fries.  My fellow Yelper ordered a plain Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza and an over-sized domestic beer.\n\nThe food took a reasonable fifteen minutes or so to get to our table.  The presentation of the burger looked great and the burger looked just as appetizing.  The fries were cooked to a golden crisp and were the perfect side dish.  Although the burger looked appetizing, it looked much better than it tasted.  The beef patty lacked flavor, felt dry, and was a disappointment all around.

Grab something to drink and maybe some popcorn. Ready? Ok..\n\nSo unlike everyone else and their mom, I have never been to the Yard House ever. And what I mean by that is, I never went to ones in SoCal. Haha. I was pretty interested in trying it out since I've heard so much about it, so I got a chance last night (the Monday right after their busy opening weekend) to check it out with some of my friends.\n\nI called in twice that day, to check if they had a waitlist and what they expected the wait times to be throughout the day. They were quick to pick up the phone and I believe had more than one person answering calls to accommodate everyone.\n\nNote 1: They will allow you to call in ahead to be put on the waitlist 30 minutes ahead of the time you come in if you have a party of 6 or less. If you have a party larger than 6, you have to come in and talk to the manager in order to be put on the waitlist.\n\nWe had a group of 10, so one of my friends gets there around 8pm and was told the wait was about an hour and a half and tells him to come back to check in and gives him a buzzer.\n\nNote 2: It will be faster if you don't mind being split up into 2 tables. I would recommend going here will a smaller party of no more than 6 because their booths can hold that much and you probably can get seated sooner.\n\nWe didn't mind waiting or walking around Santana Row, so we did that and checked in after an hour and then waited around outside and eventually got seated around 9:30 but our group was split into two tables, but they were side by side.\n\nOur server was really nice. The food comes out quick! Unfortunately they were out of a lot of taps, but it was ok bc we were still able to try a couple things.\n\nHere is a list of what I tried that night (might seem like I have a large appetite, but don't forget we had a party of 10! Had plenty of plates to share. ;) )\n\nCourses:\n\nLoaded Mac and Cheese: Really good. I especially loved the mushrooms in this dish! And this was big enough to share for 3 people per plate.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: This aint no roll, this is like a huge tartare! \nChicken Lettuce Wraps: Yummy and served with 3 different kinds of \ndipping sauces.\nCrab Cakes: Comes with 2 cakes, and they are crispy on the outside and they don't skimp on the meat! This came with some sauce on the plate and some mango salsa. Probably one of my favorite dishes of the night.\nPoke Stack: I say this is good size for the happy hour price, but I think the poke from Hukilau is better. Also comes with a good amount of julienned carrots, bean sprouts, and some avocado on the side.\n\nBeers/Drinks:\n\nHouse Honey Blonde: Standard light beer. I wouldn't order it again though, probably would get a Hef instead of this.\nYoung's Double Chocolate Stout: If Guinness and Dark chocolate had a baby, this would be it.\nDelirium Tremens: Has a good taste in the beginning, but definitely had a kick in the end. \nStrawberry something: Reminds me of Capri sun. An alcoholic bubbly strawberry Capri Sun. If that sounds good to you, try it! I liked it.\nLeinenkugel's Sunset Wheat: A refreshing light beer. Would probably order this again.\nPomegranate Press: Really good. Fruity and light, but this is probably one of those creeper drinks you will feel after a couple.\nSouthern Punch: Super good also! Another fruity mix.\n\nAlthough service was pretty solid throughout the night and food came out surprisingly quicker than expected, at the end they did take a little while to give us our bill. \n\nBut listen up: They have no problem splitting the bills. At one table of 6, we split the bill 3 ways, and in the beginning we shared 2 plates of Mac and cheese. The server was able to split the 2 plates of Mac and cheese 3 ways! That is AWESOME. Makes it much easier for the rest of us who lack the want or ability to do math after some drinking.\n\nIn the end: The food, service, and drinks were really solid. They have plenty of space at the bar and a lot of screens to catch something to watch or sports. I don't know if it's worth the 1.5hr + wait, but then again, you're in Santana Row, and you have plenty of places to check out and space to walk around to kill time. This place kind of reminds me of a much better BJ's. I would definitely come back for happy hour though.

Well, Five Guys eventually made its way here, but thats another story. \n\nI got into the soft opening by emailing corporate headquarters and asking for an invite. They online rep emailed me back shortly, and even honored my request to add a +4 to my name for their guestlist. The private event lasted from 5-8, and I regret showing up at 7! Bah, but I had a good experience for my first soft opening party. After checking in at the entrance, the hostess handed out 2 free drink vouchers per person, which was good for at least til 830pm. \n\nThe space inside is pretty reasonable, just like the other Yard Houses that I have been to. But wow, people were all over the place. Waiters were everywhere offering samples of their appetizers. I got to try the chicken penne pasta, blue crab cakes, Hawaiian pizza, korean bbq beef, and creme brulee. Best part was being able to take as much as you wanted. I've only had their sandwiches and burgers here, but all of appetizers I sampled were cooked just right. Honestly, my favorite was the creme brulee, and prior to last night, I've never had it before. Later on when the restaurant was open to the public, I had a turkey melt. Wasn't too greasy, a little spicy (which was nice), and  a generous serving of french fries. \n\nThe only about getting a lot of samples was already having a beer in your hand and not having a table. I'll get to the latter in a bit. Having over 100+ beers on tap, its truly like being a kid in a candy store. My first drink was Leinenkugel's sunset wheat. Its my favorite beer of all time, probably because it tastes like fruity pebbles. For my second drink, I asked for a recommendation for someone who likes Blue Moon and sunset wheat, and the bartender suggested a Speakeasy beer, which is based out of San Francisco. Liked the taste, but it was a subtle version of what I was seeking. Anyway, 2 beers down, 120-something to go. \n\nSo as I said earlier, place was packed. I probably waited over 2 hours til I finally ended up at a table, but that required a lot of roaming around to see if people were leaving.

A layer of bread crumbs was sprinkled on top and put under the broiler to crisp and ensure a crunchy bite.  The shiitake mushroom is a good earthy balance with the creamy cheese and smokey bacon.  I didn't care for the chicken.  We also ordered lettuce wraps.  It was good but did not amaze my taste buds although this is a great alternative to many of the fried foods on the menu.  My friend ordered the classic burger that came out with shoestring fries.  Usually the thin fries comes out dry but these were moist and very delicious.  Our bartender, Robin was very helpful and tentative to us the whole night.  She took time while serving others to answer some of my questions about beer.  She obviously had some knowledge about how beer is created and very fun to talk to.  Service with a smile even through all the chaos and demanding patrons.  \n\nThe beers I have tried:\n\nAmber: \n\nHouse Amber\nAnderson Valley Boont Amber\n\n-Both these beers are good choices if you like the amber beers (I'm sorry I can't properly describe these beers because I was not paying enough attention.  I was focusing on getting a seat)\n-I have also tried Smithwick's but not at Yardhouse.  I also recommend this beer as a great amber beer.  \n\nFruity:\n\n-Timmerman's strawberry: I thought they gave me strawberry soda.  It did  not taste like beer at all.  The color was a strange rose blond color\n-Lost Coast Apricot Wheat: This beer had a floral, apricot taste to it.  It's a light beer with the cloudy wheat look to it.  If you like blue moon, you'll probably like this beer also.  \n\nWhite Ale:\nLeinenkugel Sunset Wheat:  Do you like the cereal Fruity Pebbles? Then you will like this beer.\n\n-I have also tried some other beer on this list but just not at Yardhouse.  I recommend Great White for the floral, coriander taste and Hoegaarden for a crisp, light, floral flavor.\n\nDark: \n\nSpaten Optimator: I usually do not like the darker beers.  Amber is as dark as I go.  But with the suggestion of the bartender, I tried this beer.  It had the full body taste like any other dark beer.  The difference with this beer is the sweet maple taste that went a long with it.  Surprisingly,  I enjoyed this beer!  The lesson I learned is don't knock it until you try it.  I road off all dark beers until I came across this one.  \n\nHard Liquored Drinks:\n\nDrinks:\n\nSouthern Belle: It came in a pint class with bits of strawberry and pineapple.  Refreshing sweetness with a hint of tart\n\nTuaca Berry Blast: Very sweet.  It was served in a pint class.  I was not a fan of this because I do not like my drinks very sweet.  I prefer a little tart flavor.\n\n-Their mixed drinks are not very strong.  I tasted more fruit then liquor. \n\nMartinis:\n\nTo end the night, we had some martinis against my better judgment. \n\nStrawberry Field:  very sweet but not as sweet at the pomegranate press.  It tasted like medicine to me.  \n\nPomegranate Press: A very sweet drink.  You can taste the alcohol in this drink.  I did not like it.  I felt like I was taking medicine.  \n\n-for my martini review: I don't like martinis but you might, so don't knock it until you try it! \n\n\nI hope this long review is helpful.  Please try all the many beers this place has to offer.  I can not stand seeing people order a Budlight when there are so many other beers Yardhouse has to offer.

Overall, this probably has the best quality food for a sports bar with a wide variety (e.g. not just chicken wings).

The size is huge and the Balsamic dressing is amazing.\n-Big venue with lots of TVs.\n-Upper level is filled with kegs piped down to an oval shaped bar with 360 degree access.\n-Prices are competitive for food quality. Burgers are around $10. Sandwiches are up to $15 or 16. Entrees can be more for more expensive steak and seafood cuts.\n\nCons:\n-Lots of TVs, but no sound from the TVs (Minus 1 star). They pump in music all the time. Even during big games. I really wish they had a way to listen to games. This is a deal breaker to come during a big game. It makes it a lot less of the \"sport\" in sports bar.\n-Also can get quite noisy during happy hour and dinner. It's not a spot to have a conversation with a large group.\n\nOther items:\n-The menu is HUGE. It's deceiving because a lot is beer and drinks. The food selection is still pretty large.

There were many yards of beer being passed around and that was fun to see.  The waitress that served us was awesome and super chill.

The selection of brews on tap puts BJ's to shame and I was most pleased with my Deschutes Black Butte Porter.  As for the food, talk about some SERIOUSLY GOOD happy hour deals!  My buddy and I threw caution to the wind and went to town on a Margharita pizza, Spicy Thai chicken pizza, Hawaiian poke stack, and Seared ahi sashimi.  The pizzas were the about the same size as CPK's at less than half the price and the raw fish was very solid especially for the price.  I did notice that the cooks are a bit heavy-handed with the salt though on Thai chicken pizza and the sauce for the sashimi, so bear that in mind if you're on the salt-sensitive side.\n\nIn a nutshell, Yard House is basically BJ's Version 2.0 - more upscale, superior happy hour deals, more well-trained staff and, most importantly, more quality brews =D", "name": "Yard House", "rating": 4}, {"index": 2133, "review": "Long waits, but good service.

Why do people wait 2 hours for this place? And why was I one of those people? SMH. I've heard everyone rave about this place and when Yard House finally made its Northern California debut, I was definitely intrigued. Then I heard about the outrageous wait times at this place and I was quickly turned off.\n\nBut one fateful Saturday night brought me here for dinner. I was having dinner with some of my San Jose friends and I suggested that we go here for dinner, since this place is so hyped up; I consider myself a hype-monger, who seeks to try only the newest and the hottest \"ish.\" \n\nI stopped by Yard House at 6pm to put my name down on the wait list. I was quoted a wait time of 2 hours. Goodness gracious. Normally I would have said \"eff this\" and gone some where else to eat. But I was sort of set on YH, so I put my name down and just went shopping at Valley Fair Mall for 2 hours. \n\nFast forward to 8pm and my table is finally ready. This place reminds of BJ's. They have a similar decor and seating arrangements. \n\nLet me preface my review, by saying yes they have a lot of beers on tap, but honestly their beer selection is pretty mediocre. You can pretty much find any of those beers at a Whole Foods or a BevMo. If you are a true brew snob, get ready to be disappointed.\n\nBut if you are someone who considers themselves a non-beer snob, there are some good things about this place. One thing that YH does well is that it gets a lot of my non-beer drinking friends to actually drink beer. They forgo the fou-fou cocktail drinks and indulge in the elixir of the gods, beer. Plus beer served by the half-yard is a nice touch as well.\n\nThe food here is not bad. The portion sizes are pretty huge; think Cheesecake Factory or Applebee's huge.\n\nFor starters, my friends and I had the onion ring tower. The name pretty much describes the meal. Onion rings arranged in the shape of a tower.\n\nFor my main entree, I ordered the crab crusted swordfish. This dish was alright. I felt that the swordfish was a little too overcooked for my liking, so the fish turned out dry and stringy. But ignoring the texture of the food, I thought the flavors were great. The fish was topped with a lemon grass white sauce, which was both citrus-y and creamy. I was huge fan of the wasabi mashed potatoes and thought this unique combination worked well together.\n\nI sampled my friends' entrees, which included the mac and cheese, fried chicken breast and the lobster garlic noodles. I was huge fan of the mac and cheese because it was littered with pieces of bacon and chicken. The fried chicken was especially crispy and worked well with the helping of mashed potatoes and gravy it was accompanied with. The lobster garlic noodles is a good dish if you love comma inducing and extra buttery carbs, oh yeah and seafood; the garlic noodles were topped with large chunks of lobster and shrimp.\n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate souffle. This was a pretty decent dessert. Thank you for the YH staff for paying me to courtesy of topping off my dessert with a birthday candle and spelling out \"Happy Birthday\" with cocoa powder. Thanks again. \n\nOverall, this place is alright if you want to get a beer, but the wait time is pretty outrageous. Wait till the hype dies down and then this place will be a lot better.

If you get here before the dinner crowd, the wait is actually bearable.  Bar seating is usually full, but if you wait a bit or circle around a few times, seats do open up.  For a table, the wait today at 4:30pm was about 15 minutes.  We decided to shop around SR for a bit and when we came back about 45 minutes later, the wait was about 30 to 45 minutes.

It's a nice spot to just eat/hang out with friends/family and doesn't have the super snooty feeling that you might get at other SR restaurants.  The bar area is pretty nice - it's right smack in the middle of the restaurant so the seats circle all the way around.  They do have a ton of beers on tap and that takes up the island at the bar.\n\nPrices are a tad on the high end here.  I believe most beers are $6/pint.  They also have half yards which are the long glasses of beer - that runs about $13.  It's actually 2 pints worth of beer, so they're basically making an extra buck from you for the novelty of having a gigantic glass.  As for food, the only things I saw that were \"reasonably\" priced were probably the appetizers and the soups.  Excluding those and appetizer salads, almost everything was above $10.  \n\nI have yet to eat a meal here, but have tried the sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and onion ring tower.  All 3 are fairly solid appetizers.  At first, the portions for the fries looked small, but they did last for awhile.

I guess it was reasonable considering that there was a game that night and we had 8 people in our party. We were chillen most of the time at the bar ordering drinks and waiting to be seated. My favorite drink was the MALIBU PEACH =) The beers were cool too..\n\nAnyways, we were all so HUNGRY that we decided to order our food at the bar (since we looked around and saw that the people sitting at tables were waiting forever for their food). Good thing we did that because minutes after we got seated, our food arrived. We were all first timers and had no idea what to order.. so we kinda ordered a bit of everything from the appetizer menu. I especially enjoyed the lettuce wrap and the garlic noodles. Everything else was pretty decent too. My friend ordered the Spicy Jambalaya (an entree) which was pretty yummy too. \n\nHonestly, this place is really nice. I liked the atmosphere and the decor inside. It's very loud and lively. However, the wait is pretty ridiculous and really kills your mood when you're STARVING. And another reason why this place does not get 5 stars is because of an incident that happened when I was there. My friend walked to the bathroom by herself and the floor near the bathroom was wet. She slipped and (luckily) fell on her knees. There were about 2 employees standing RIGHT THERE and they just looked at her with blank stares and then went back to talking like nothing happened. They didn't even ask if she was okay or anything! HELLO?! LIABILITY?! Anyways, she later complained to the manager and told him that she was okay, but thought it was very rude that the employees did NOTHING when it happened. He apologized and later said that the employees DID reported it-- which is complete BS because they went back to talking to each other after she slipped. I think he said that only because he was afraid she would sue and that's understandable. The manager was nice to us, but the fact that their employees were idiots was the reason I held back on that last star. I just felt bad for my friend because she came out with her knees SOAKED like she fell into a puddle-- which was kinda what happened. This place is dark and it's dangerous that their staff didn't clean up the spill.. Maybe if they did their job instead of standing around chatting.. Hmm I don't know..

It seemed like either she couldn't hear me well or she didn't know what I was talking about until I pointed specifically to the menu. Her descriptions also weren't very helpful and she used really vague words. I asked about one of the beers they had and she just used the keywords that were printed on the menu for that type of beer.

Yard House corporate called me this afternoon, and offered me a gift card to re-visit them. A new review will be up soon! That being said, I am impressed with Yard House's quick response to my review as well as the measure they have taken to fix this. The incident last night is probably more of a one-off rather then a reflection of Yard House's full attitude.\n_______________________\n\nWe got the worst of service last night. That being said, it was not my first time to Yard House and I had experienced much better. In fact, my group and I were there earlier this week (Monday night) to celebrate a friend's birthday and we were wonderfully served by Jessica. She was great throughout the night and we were so impressed that we decided to come back Thursday night for another friend's birthday. BIG MISTAKE.\n\nFirst, the wait. We had to switch from a party of 6 to 8 as more people were joining us. When I told the hostess that, she told me very rudely to stand in a corner and wait for the manager to come talk to us. Ten minutes later and still no one talked to us. I went up to her again and asked for details and to my surprise, nothing had been done and I was still on the small table list! I asked for them to switch my name to the big table list immediately in front of me instead of waiting for someone to come talk to us (I don't know what the policy on that is and why is that) We ended up waiting an extra half hour in addition to the original hour they told us. (we got there about 630 and got seated about 8)\n\nThat in all was still acceptable. Yard House is a busy establishment, we know. We were willing to overlook that in anticipation of celebrating my friend's birthday and the wonderful food and service that we got like Monday night.\n\nBoy, were we in for a surprise!\n\nThe moment we sat down at our table, our server, Krystal (I think that's how you spell it) did not even greet us or smile. She asked us what we wanted to start with, just like that. Mind you, it was a big party and some people had not even settled down yet, let alone open our menus. She kept rushing us what we wanted to order. I ordered a half yard cider and since only me and another friend were drinking, she kept walking around us to make sure of that, LIKE WE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED. This was particularly felt when I asked for an empty glass to pour the half yard to myself, she kept insisting to check the ID of whoever was drinking it. I told her it was me and she rolled her eyes like she did not believe me.\n\nWe were not happy then but still willing to overlook that since we were a group of people over and under 21 and understood the concern of our server.\n\nWhatever happened next was the worst. Our server kept hovering over our table and refilled water even when we did not ask her to. Every time she refilled our water glass, she would slam it down in front of us. It got so bad that droplets of water flew onto my friend's food. When we told her that we did not want our waters filled anymore, (as we wanted to avoid a scene) she went ahead and filled it anyway (and again, rolling her eyes) and proceeded to slam plates of our food onto our table.\n\nAlso, when my one friend who was drinking had finished his half yard and ordered pints instead, the waitress refused to serve him until he chugged everything down. He did not want whatever that was in the half yard anymore! He wanted a new one. She could have just taken the glass away but instead, she said she would not serve him until he finished it. Talk about attitude!\n\nWith that being said, I made a complain to the manager and he was nice about it. I told him that we could not eat in peace with someone walking around us all the time and slamming things onto our table. He told us that we were being closely watched as we ordered 2 half yards and 5 empty glasses. NO? we had 2 half yards and 2 empty glasses for me and my friend. Talk about miscommunication. I was very angry at this point and told him if he wanted, he could conduct a breathalyzer check on us. So much for trustworthiness. He apologized again and agreed to change our server, but it was too late. At this point, we were all too upset and just wanted to leave. The manager said that he would do something to \"make up for the birthday boy\" and a birthday souffl\u00e9 was served to us. This is not our first birthday spent there and we happen to know that this place gives out free souffl\u00e9 to everyone celebrating a birthday. No big deal.\n\nWhen we got our bill, gratuity was included. We wanted to ask to take it off but such an unpleasant dining experience just prompted us to pay and get out of there as soon as possible. I forgot my scarf when I left and had to return to get it, I saw our original rude and mistrusting server grabbing our tip instead of the new server.

We went early (around 5pm) to catch happy hour. I definitely recommend going early if you don't want to take on the crazy wait that seemed to be starting around 7. I was pleasantly surprised that Happy hour is offered to the entire restaurant and not just applicable in certain areas (i.e. only at the bar). Happy hour offerings include half priced sliders, pizzas and random selections from the main app menu along with discount drinks. \nThe Spicy Tuna Roll is served uniquely as a layered dish of edamame beans, cucumber, onion, spicy tuna and avocado with shredded seaweed mixed in. Delicious! The pizza was good and the Moo Shu Chicken Egg Rolls were a nice surprise of crispy, yummy goodness. The mac & cheese had nice chunks of bacon, chicken and wild mushrooms in it but the chicken was a bit chewy and I felt like the dish was more cream than cheese heavy. At the end of the meal they brought out a yummy mini lemon souffl\u00e9 with a candle for my birthday. Sweet. \nThe beer, the beer!  We started off with the Belgian Six Pack (6 beers, 3 oz of each), a good way to try a lot of beers without ordering a full glass. They have one other set tasting they call \"Traditional\" which is 6 beers, 5oz each. Unfortunately you can't make your own tasting but the good news is each person can get two free tastes (about 1oz).  \nWith over 100 beers on tap and decent happy hour pricing, the Yard House is definitely a place I will return to. With that said, a little extra attention would get them the five star mark. Service was quick and friendly but I was surprised that the staff didn't seem very well educated on the beers and how to recommend the best option based on their patron's tastes. While they definitely showed love of beer I would expect better training for a place whose \"big thing\" is beer.

I'm no vegetarian myself, but every once in a while I like to skip the meat in my meals.  The Gardein substitutions for meat are done well.

Their Hef was alright, I ended up going with a pint of their Leffe. They also sell their beers in what they call a \"Half a Yard\" which are these big big tall glasses that are about 2.5 pints. \n\nI then flip the page and again overwhelmed by so many menu items that all sounded delicious. They seemed to have everything! We ended up ordering the Garlic Noodles, Crab Cakes, and Ahi Crunchy salad for appetizer. You can add and of their soups for only $2.95 with an entree so we also got some Clam Chowder. The garlic noodles and Ahi Crunchy was memorable! Pretty good in terms of taste and flavors. The Ahi was a little bit salty for me but still good nonetheless.\n\nFor entree, I shared a Parmesen Crusted Chicken served on top of Mashed Potatoes. This was also pretty good, similar to Gordon Biersch's. Their entrees are pretty huge and good to share. For dessert, they brought me out a birthday surprise Chocolate Lava Cake which I devoured in minutes. That was yummy for sure!\n\nIt was fun.

The food: well, it really is just your usual either overpriced or upscale (however you wanna look at it) funky fusion. But the beer! Well, they charge the right amount (about 6-7 for a pint. You're a fool if you order one of those tallboys of anything but the bud...even then you're still a fool. This ain't vegas, son!) and you get a really amazing selection of hard to get beers. I had the ommegang Belgian blonde, the Kostrizer Dark, Lost Coast great white, and I think a repeat of one of these. The kostritzer was great: light weight, chocolatey yet smokey body, with a clean, effervescent finish that left no aftertaste. Awesome for a dark I might add. \n\nBut this isn't  a beer review! This is an institution review! \n\nCool place: nice vibe, great decor (in terms of seating and table design), very friendly staff (as you might expect of the cheesecake factory of beer gardens). Crowded as hell (quite literally I bet!) but if you're not there to eat, the bartenders are about as efficient as you want them to be: johnny on the spot before and after order.

And quite frankly, I don't know how to feel about this place, but I'll give you guys a basic walk through.\n\nFood:\nHalf our table of six ordered burgers. I had ordered a plate of garlic noodles and split a burger with my friend. The patty in our burger was salted in a very uneven manner...some bites were pretty good, others were extremely salty. This goes for the garlic fries too, super unevenly salted. And this was confirmed by everyone who tried the burgers, so it wasn't just our luck. My order of chicken garlic noodles was very oily, as well as my friend's mac&cheese, which is supposedly one of Yardhouse's more popular dishes btw. However, in honor of my friend's birthday, she did get a free souffle with vanilla bean ice cream--which I thought was the only close to perfect item that any of us had tonight. Otherwise their food was not evenly season, super oily, and overpriced. I could have easily gotten that same measly plate somewhere else for way less than how much I paid here. And for the burgers, I would have gladly chosen The Counter in the same area or saved my gourmet burger needs for Umami. \n\nService:\nOur waiter was super friendly, he always came to refill our waters. He was very patient and very detail-oriented. I pay a lot of attention on how many times a server comes around to check up on his/her tables and that's how I determine the difference between a less than or equal to 10% tip and a 15% tip. But our food took quite a while to come to us...and when we paid with cash for part of our bill, we didn't get any change. We wanted the change to see how much we should tip since we were there with a group, splitting the check is always a hassle. So I left tossing in an extra $3, not knowing how much the total tip was..we would have totally given more if we had gotten everything back clearly. +1 for service, +1 for a handsome server.\n\nAtmosphere:\nIt was a little dark here...I almost couldn't see my food because of how dark it was here.

I anxiously waited when they initially said they were going to open in February. I was impatiently craving to have another Vodka shrimp. But this time, I decided to try something new. I had the Chinese Garlic Noodles and it was full of flavor. The garlic taste was scrumptious. Its a must try if you're a fan of garlic.

I was there for the food.  The husband was there to try their pour of Guinness.\n\nBeing happy hour, we ordered items with the intention of sharing.  We had the half price appetizers of classic sliders, substituting truffle fries (+$1.00) in place of regular, the traditional buffalo wings, and a lunch sized portion of the mac and cheese.\n\nClassic sliders:  the beef patties had a good flavor and were tender.  The garlic aioli was very light in flavor and added moisture to the patty.  I would order these again, but try out the other variations.\n\nTruffle fries: I was slightly disappointed that they were shoestring fries, and only because I'm more of a fan of thicker cuts.  The taste was comprised more of the parmesan cheese for some bites, and more truffle-like for some.  Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of these, but I think I would do some things differently like a little less parmesan and a little more parsley for a fresher taste to complement the earthiness of the truffle oil.\n\nTraditional bone-in buffalo wings:  crispy, hot (temperature), and spicy, everything a good hot wing should be.  I was surprised to see what looked like cracked black pepper on them, but whatever.  It didn't ruin it.  The sauce was spicier than expected out of a traditional buffalo sauce, and that is a good thing.\n\nJust when I thought I was satisfied and content with sitting and waiting for the husband to finish his second round, the dessert menu arrived at the table.  The first half of the offerings were small portions and cost less than $5.00.  We opted for the creme brulee.\n\nCreme brulee:  two caramelized banana pieces beside a cute little ramekin of deliciousness.  The crispy top-shell was executed really well; it was evenly brown and had a great crunch sound as I stabbed into it with my spoon. A perfect portion for two to taste, but I was slightly put off by the chocolate bottom \"crust.\"  I wasn't really in the mood for chocolate and this just happened to be there.  It wasn't bad, but I preferred to be rejoicing in the vanilla/caramel/banana goodness.\n\nOverall, service was prompt and attentive, and the restaurant was busy but not slammed.

Your food is not good and expensive, your beer is exorbitantly priced, your clientele is clueless and wasteful*, but hey, at least your waitstaff is polite!\n\n* I totally saw a girl order a half-yard of Guinness, take one sip, sign the check, and leave. What.\n\nThe truffle fries were delicious, and the sweet potato fries were pretty good too. But here's the thing. All of the main dish food is so ugh, so \"I could have cooked this better at home\", so bleh. BJ's (and about a million other places) does it better, for cheaper, without all the trendy bullshit attitude of YH. Let me list my complaints more specifically.\n\n1) Beer selection is good - but the prices are outrageous. There's a reason they don't put a single price for any beer or any size on the menu. It's because they're going to rob you blind and never look back. My biggest gripe? The half-yard is 2 pints, right? I ordered a pint of Allagash White, one of my favorite beers. Turns out it was $6.50. But my boyfriend got a half-yard of the exact same beer - twice the amount - and it cost... $14. So...he could have bought two pints of it in regular pint glasses, saved himself the awkwardness of the stupidly shaped half-yard glass, and saved a dollar while he was at it. Huh????\n\n2) This place pretends to be a beer-lover's dream, when in actuality it caters to the general clueless beer-consuming public. Maybe it makes me a snob, okay, but come on...when the waitress calls SeaDog Blueberry Wheat \"like a blueberry Blue Moon\" and then when we go \"uhhh, what?\" she says \"well, it's just 'cause, like, Blue Moon is a wheat beer, and this is a blueberry wheat beer\". If you're serving 100 different beers you better know something more about beer than that! Come on! And then when we were trying to decide a beer for my boyfriend's mom, trying to get the waitress' help to choose a beer, and my boyfriend helpfully explains that she doesn't like hefs or white ales because of the strong \"spicy\" tastes like coriander and cloves -- the waitress goes \"woah, woah, okay...just trying to help...uh....why don't you just get uh....uh....\" And then just stares at us. Please. If you want 100 choices of beer and people who know what they're talking about, go to 99 Bottles in Santa Cruz. Or BevMo, for god's sake. \n\n3) The food. Now, don't get me wrong, those truffle fries were damn good. But my grilled cheese --- something that's REALLY EASY to make -- was not so good. It was extremely greasy, like, dripping with oil. There's enough fat inside of it, you don't have to soak the bread in pure butter to throw it on the grill for 2 minutes. It was gross. And the tomatoes in it were sickly sweet like they'd been sitting in a container of sugar water all afternoon. The \"customer favorite\" tomato bisque the waitress highly recommended? Also overpoweringly sweet. And the kicker -- the grilled artichoke, something already overpriced and something anyone can do okay and only some places can do great -- was DISGUSTING. It tasted like lighter fluid, and I'm not just being over-the-top here. You could taste the lighter fluid they used to light their little grill to \"cook\" it. I put the quotation marks because that artichoke was not cooked. Not AT ALL. Way to take a $2 piece of produce, charge me $10 for it, douse it in chemicals, and not even make it edible. Where did this kitchen crew learn to cook??? Not even the heart of the artichoke was cooked. When the waitress asked me how I liked it, I tried a polite \"em......not really\" and she looked shocked. Shocked, I tell you. Yard House, let me just tell you, as a big artichoke fan, you're on my black list. I shudder at the memory of it.\n\n4) The price. Way overpriced. Not worth it.

And there was definitely no place to sit at the bar.

Our waitresses were really  nice in letting us do that. When we got our table, I ordered their Timmerman's Strawberry and my boyfriend for their half-yard of Racer 5. I loved my beer. Being a girl, it was super fruity and just a slight hint of bite just to remind you it was a beer. The Racer 5 was too bitter for my taste but my boyfriend loved it. We also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll which wasn't a roll at all but more of like a circular tartare. It was pretty good. Definitely bigger portion than I wanted cause we got kind of sick of it after a while.\n\nOur second round, I got another fruity beer, Lindeman's Framboise. This one didn't taste like beer at all. It tasted like raspberry soda or something like that and it was delicious. My boyfriend got 21st amendment brewery's Brew Free or Die! IPA which he said was similar to Racer 5 except it was less hoppy. We also got an order of sweet potato fries and a margherita pizza. The dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries was the only weird thing. I didn't like it because it was too sweet to dip with sweet potato fries. It tasted like maple syrup but again my boyfriend liked it so it's a preference thing. The pizza was super good.

It does have a bar feeling, so it's slightly loud but the yardhouse is known for their beers so I feel like that should go without being said.

In this case, it just didn't measure up to my standards.\n\nService initially was great. The waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs. I'm not even upset with the waitress, even though she made a big \"oops\". By \"oops\" i mean she dumped drinks on my coworker and I on accident. I was soaked, my entire right side, jacket and pants were wet and smelling of Vodka. Sitting through dinner with sticky, wet pants = not a good time.  She apologized and her manager came over to apologize, he asked if I wanted another drink. I had a full martini in front of me and planned on driving. I already smelled like a booze factory, another drink would not have been smart,  I  nicely declined his offer. I assumed they would take something off the bill, bring over a gift card or do something to show they were really sorry for the mess that took place. They brought us the bill and nothing had been done. To top it off they charged us $7.75 for martinis that should have been $6.\n\nWe had to ask to speak to another manager. He then came out and he explained the fact they did nothing was unacceptable and he would like to take care of our dry cleaning. He wanted to take down our info. Are you kidding?!! Do you think I want to go bring my stuff to a dry cleaner when i can wash it myself then bring back a stupid dry cleaning tag to get reimbursed? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard and a HUGE inconvenience to me. It's our mistake for not bringing the bill to the waitresses attention and saying we should have been comped for something, but I'm not one to ask for things. I'm big on customer service and when drinks have been poured on someone they should be offered something to make up for it not have to go searching for a manager and ask to be comped. \n\nSo end of story....had great expectations for this place, enjoyed the food.

The pastrami was very moist and felt like it melted in your mouth.And the french fries are thin almost looking like fried onion strings and so addictive.

But clearly, we cant. \n\nI've heard SO many reviews from my friends to try out Yard House. So my friends and I went to the Yard House on a Saturday night. We got there around 1015pm, and the wait was about 20 minutes. But, that's fine..it's a saturday night so that's understandable. We all got drinks at the bar and chilled as we waited. \n\nGot sat at a table around 10:35. We ordered a couple more drinks. The server informed us that the kitchen was about to close at 11 and advised us to order soon. So, in retrospect, that was nice of the server to warn us. Another friend joined us so we ordered a couple of appetizers by 11. At this point, i was told to order the fries (from those very friends that told me to go to the Yard House). We decided to order the REGULAR fries just to try it out first. I'm not sure why the side of fries came out before the rest of the appetizers but doesn't matter at least it's something out. My friend and I really don't like any seasonings on the fries (hence why we order REGULAR fries) but we noticed that there was some cheese and parsley on the fries. We ate it and thought it was GARLIC fries...our other friends, who didnt even know that we ordered fries, even asked us if we ordered GARLIC fries. So that was a fail already.  The server came back around and informed us that the bar was closing at 11:30 (maybe because they were closing at 12?) i'm not sure. So my friends ordered some more drinks. by 11:45 one of the restaurant employees said to us \"we are closing in 15 mins so you need to finish up.\" They turned off all of their TV screens and turned on the normal lights. Fail #2 \n\nI'm not quite sure what the problem was. If they were closing at 12, then why rush us already? We just got our refill of drinks. But, ok. We tried to rush it. at 11:50 another employees comes up to us \"you need to hurry it up, we're closing at 12.\" Again, I'm not sure what the problem is...i've heard of restaurants closing their doors at 12 but not FORCING paying guests out. So, alright. We were almost done with our drinks so the girls went to the bathroom before they closed. At 11:55 the manager comes to us. I told her that the three girls were in the bathroom and that they would be right out. Sadly, the manager said \"you need to get off the table now. Grab the girl's purse, and you can finish your beer at the door.\" What the hell is going on? it's not even 12 yet! Then while we were waiting at the door for the girls, one of the bouncers told my friend to finish his beer then asked us to leave but said it was ok after we told him that we're waiting for the girls to leave the bathroom. \n\nIn any case, one of the worst experiences that I've had at a restaurant. I usually give restaurants a second try but this type of \"forcing guests out by the time the restaurant closes\" seems to be a procedural process so I don't think it would be different on another day.

It was so good we went there several times during our trip which says a lot when you are in Hawaii.  When I heard one opened in Santana Row I had to give it a try.\nWe were a party of 7 and unfortunately they only take reservations for 10 or more and the place was packed.  Be prepared for a long wait, it could be a hour or so.  The place was extremely loud so with a large round table there was no hope of talking to the person across from you and difficult even if they were sitting close.   Although it was noisy it did make for an energetic atmosphere which is better than a quiet place especially If you don't know the people you are dining with well.  \nWe didn't get to experience the bar beyond a stroll around looking for a seat but it is a large rectangle in the middle of the room, my favorite kind of bar with tables and booths surrounding it.  The bar will be my next seating preference.   If you are a big beer drinker they half yard beers are amusing to watch people drink with two hands.\nGreat thing about a large group is we ordered it all.   Starting with coconut shrimp on a bed of what I believe was carrots and radishes in a sweet tangy red sauce, buffalo wings, fried calamari and lobster crab artichoke dip with pita and chips.  I've listed them starting from best to good, nothing was bad, the coconut shrimp was excellent, the buffalo wings hit my top five and the calamari was tender.  Next I tried the caesar salad which was way too lemony.  I did like the parmesan crisps but wouldn't order that again.  For my entr\u00e9e I had the Porcini Crusted Halibut with parmesan mashed potatoes with a porcini cream sauce, white truffle oil, asparagus and bok choy.  The fish was dry and overcooked, the porcini cream sauce was tasty, the asparagus was fine but the bok choy was silly.  Baby book choy and the ends cut off would have been more appetizing.  They were huge, served in a bowl which made it impossible to cut up and the root end wasn't appealing.  I wouldn't order again.  The pepper crusted filet with parmesan mashed potatoes, asparagus, carrots and the brandy shallot cream sauce was excellent.  A definite reorder.   And if you think there wasn't any room left, you are wrong, when \"mini\" is in front of a dessert there is always room, especially if you share.  We tried the Mini Tri Sampler and were able to mix it up a bit with the lemon souffl\u00e9, chocolate souffl\u00e9 and instead of the peach apple cobbler I had to try my favorite dessert, cr\u00e8me brulee with vanilla bean custard and chocolate topped with caramelized bananas.  Happily it didn't disappoint, it was the best cr\u00e8me brulee ever.  When it comes to brulee I'm a purest, plain please, but the bananas on top were to die for so much so I don't even remember the chocolate.  The lemon souffl\u00e9 was light and fluffy and if you are a chocolate lover you will enjoy this rich souffle.

I was able to try their strawberry beer and raspberry cider that my friends ordered and they were good too. I'd probably order those next time. \nAs for food, my friend and I split the lobster, crab and artichoke dip. It was good but eat it when it's hot. As it sat out and got cold it wasn't as good. For my entree, I got the grilled shrimp caesar salad. As the description says, jumbo shrimp, they aren't kidding. The four shrimp were BIG and cooked perfectly!

We had a party of about 14 and asked WAY ahead of time to make a reservation which we were denied forcing us to arrive early (2 hours, luckily the birthday person didn't have to endure our excruciating wait due to their time schedule fumble lol). After receiving TWO estimated times, both after the other consisting of 20 minutes, we finally decided to just go inside (I would have been a lot more fine with things if they said an hour to give them cushion space) and go to the bar as a whole party and coincidentally (I Feel) our buzzer went off after a third of us ordered drinks with the busy yet very attentive bartenders. I myself and 2 others from my party ordered our drinks a bit late so were kind of left at the bar while everybody else was seated. Arriving at the table, there were chairs for Each one of us (obviously) so of course one would expect the table to receive the same amount of menus and silverware as people being seated. One of our waiters seemed a bit \"closed mouths don't get fed\" if you will with his attitude. I had to sort of lock eyes twice with the guy, get ignored, and call out for his attention. Received the menus, silverware, ordered drinks, ordered food. Was given a heads up by our other waiter, who seemed to have taken over, that they were busy and that things Do take about 15 mins, which was fine and we totally understood. We all WERE Trying to enjoy our drinks as the food was being prepared but, MAN, maybe if we weren't colored we would have been getting less attention from One of the security guards who seemed to be targeting us locking eyes with everyone facing his direction. There was another party who wasn't colored who had the same amount of people who seemed to receive NO attention. After a few people confirmed with each other that they felt uneasy because of that Same security guard, we ALL cheered our glasses to him in hopes of showing him we were there to enjoy ourselves and That Only,  which seemed to have left him feeling caught that he was \"monitoring\" us making him leave (YES!!!). Surely enough he returned a few times,  when someone in my party asked him why he is so stressed out over us he replied, \"I'm here to make sure you guys are cool\", my party then asked why he isn't so worried about the other party of the same size and he just stayed quite (what kind of prejudice a** sh*t is that Yardhouse? Just point the cameras at us instead of having some online certified Mickey Mouse breathe down our necks trying to Emmet Till us ruining the experience at your establishment). Food came out pretty scheduled to our waiters word, everything (from what I heard) was on point with the order. Food arrived at the table and OVERWHELMED the amount of space they thought was going to be able to fit all our food (an extra table would have been nice tho I'm not sure it would have fit with the seating arrangement for the busy night?) but yet everyone's food WAS enjoyed along with beverages. About half way through the meal we had to Tetris our plates, and in doing so we found on the table a little flyer indicating big parties such as ourselves to MAKE RESERVATIONS (ain't That some dog sh*t). Our waiter (who pretty much took over) was attentive without being intrusive and kept it 100 without stepping out of his professional environment both verbally and physically which is service I personally feel EVERYone should receive. 2 waiters brought our checks, one of them the attentive waiter and the Other one the ont that I guess forgot about us. We established HOW our checks were going to be split when we ordered, the waiter who forgot about us came back clueless with how the checks were getting split (c'mon cat) and completely messed our totals up. The other waiter fixed our checks and was able to sort of neutralize some of the negativity in our experience.

She took our drink order and checked everyones ID. We ordered our food and some of us ordered starters. Natalie even asked me if we wanted some of these things as our meal or as starters and I replied yes and she said \"ok something to snack on first.\" With that said.. did we ever get it? No! Our food started to come in, but it tapered onto our table. About halfway through the meals of those who received it, I asked where my meal was along with 2 other people AND our starters. She said \"oh those didn't come out yet?\" Obviously NOT otherwise I would be eating. So 5 minutes later ( I think she didn't place the order or forgot) outcome our burgers. Because MY order truffle fries hadn't arrived, I told her to cancel my order. A few minutes later, my friend called her over to ask where her order of truffle fries. Natalie looked at me and said \"I thought you cancelled the truffle fries?\" I told her I cancelled only MY order and not anyone else. Oh she also brought my other friend a carne asada taco when she ordered a pork belly taco and after my friend looked at it and told her that this is not pork belly she argued that it was pork belly. My friend pointed at another plate on the table and asked then whats that (knowing she was pointing at a pork belly taco) Natalie said its pork belly. So my friend asked, \"then why does mine look different?!\" So then Natalie told her because she ordered a different kind of pork belly taco.. well my friend knew there was only one kind of pork belly on the menu, but again, Natalie argued and thought she was right. She brought over a menu and to her dismay, she was MODED. Get your facts straight girl. So she FINALLY took the carne asada taco back and brought her a correct order. To sum it up, our bill still had BOTH orders of truffle fries when in fact there should've only been 1 order. I called her over and complained and told her to take it off of the menu then she said \"but she still wanted her truffle fries.\" So I said \"initially I ordered truffle fries. Either you forgot them, or the order was never placed so I talk to you to cancel them. So why is it still on the bill?! And again, blamed \"somebody else\" by saying \"I don't know why they keep doing that?!\" Man, if shes our server shouldn't she been handling the orders/bill?! And who is \"THEY\"?

Check my cell phone, its only 11:50. Their hours say that they are open until 12, so why are they kicking is out now? i would understand if he was pushing us to leave if we were lingering after hours, but it was still within the posted hours! And it was not like we were the last ones there. Also, he only told OUR party that it was time to go, and he told us TWICE, when we had not heard him tell the party in the booth behind us, nor did he tell the patrons at the bar that they had to leave. So, we definitely felt singled out, and I don't know why because we were not a sloppy nor loud party. So we were very disappointed and frustrated with the service, so i REALLY HOPE that he is NOT the manager, because that is SAD SAD SAD.

Once it came out, I took a bite without looking at my burger because I didn't think she would screw it up.  After my bite, I saw a big green bell pepper with the beef patty.  Before I tried to wave our waitress down, I want to make sure that it was NOT the burger I ordered. I never had a gorgonzola burger, but I clearly remembered that there are mushrooms in it from the description on the menu before ordering. It took a long time for her to come. When she finally came, I told her that it was the wrong burger. She even confirmed it with me a few times when she first took our orders, and she even said the name of my burger before looking at it. After looking at it, she went to check. She came back apologizing that she entered my order wrong. I am like really? you didn't bother double checking what you entered especially when it's ONLY 2 ITEMS? She asked me if I would like the kitchen to make my original order. I told her it's okay because I didn't want to waste food. (Luckily, I can eat peppers.) Then she told me that she will speak to the manager to give us complimentary desserts or take my order off the bill. As I was eating the wrong burger, she apologized once again when pass by our table to cater other tables. She didn't check with us or anything the whole time we were there. I did not enjoy that burger at all. I could barely finished it because it was not good. When she finally gave us the bill, I asked my friend if I can see it. And you know what? she didn't do anything to compensate for her mistake or give us an update from her manager. We ended up paying the bill but she wouldn't pick it up even though she passed by our table 5-6 times. It was really frustrating!! When she finally picked it up, we waited forever to get it back.\n\n Also, we were annoyed by other customers who were standing and leaning on our chairs since we were placed near the bar. The whole  experience was horrible! with customers leaning on your chair, your waitress messed up your order and didn't do anything about it, and didn't come to  check up on us even though she passed by numerous times.

For appetizers, we had the Poke.  Let's start with the Poke.  Disappointing!  To be fair, I will forever compare Poke experiences to the one I had in Hawaii and then against Hukilau in San Francisco, so it will pale in comparison.  However, it is decent.  The soy sauce was a bit salty for my taste.  We ordered a salad with the meal and it was a pretty bland salad - nothing special.  We wanted to try an in-house brewed beer and the waiter tried to help us with choices.  We ended up with an original Hef and a darker ale - but I felt it wasn't as unique of an experience as had hoped.  They do have a happy hour option for beers, so you might want to come after 10pm.  The Blue Crab Cake sandwich was ok.  Again, nothing over the top special.  The bread felt processed and bought in bulk and I'm hoping the crab cake didn't come from frozen, but I have a feeling it was.  Compared to the crab cakes in Baltimore, this is the weakest crab cake ever!!  I like biting into a crab cake and feeling a lump of crab or at least seeing a piece of lump, but it was a ton of breading.  The fries were good - thin and crispy, how I typically like.  The Chicken Parmesan was salty with a variety of mushrooms floating in the sauce.\n\nThe waiter was friendly and tried hard, but he didn't know the menu that well.  \n\nOverall, a true 3-star restaurant - guaranteed a decent experience, but don't expect more than that.", "name": "Yard House", "rating": 3}, {"index": 2768, "review": "I love coming here for the late night happy hour, it's a really good deal on appetizers.

Not Yard House's mistake or that there was a long line ahead of us but because of patrons who had finished their meal, cleared their check, and chose to still linger at the table socializing. This was frustrating because the earliest member of our group who got there had to wait way over an hour to sit down.

I lived in Belgium for a while and I appreciate the unique lambic style beers.  There beers are the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars.\n\nThe first time I came here was with a friend.  The food was decent and the service alright.  We had to wait about 20 minutes or so for a table but that was no big deal.  However I would not wait any longer than that for a table.

Apparently after a certain time of night they ID people to make sure they are over 21 which is weird because they are also a restaurant.  \n\nWhat really made me dislike this place was the way they treat their customers.  My friend spilled an expensive glass of beer on herself, broke the glass, and had red beer all over her white sweater and her pants.  The bartender basically gave her a rag and walked away.  It took about 5 minutes to get another bartender's attention to ask if she could get a replacement drink because she had spilled it.  (and no she was not drunk).  The bartender said she would have to ask the manager on duty.  That took about another 10 minutes.  Finally the manager came over and gave her a free drink, but it was such a hassle.  There are no apology, no sense of urgency, they just treated our friend as just another person in the large crowd which is exactly what Yard House is.  There should have been no need to get a manager involved in what seems like an easy thing to fix.  It also did not seem like they had enough people staffing the bar.  That might help with customer service.    \n\nThe other thing that annoyed me that night was at 11:45 they had security guards walking around telling people they had to get out.  Literally.  They told people it was time to go...and not in a nice way.   They could have asked people, or informed them the place was closing in a much better way.  There was no last call.

I highly commend the choice of location as well - conveniently at the end of Santana Row. This is a great restaurant with quality food for less than the average price at The Row. I am a fan of the truffle fries, lobster burger and kona coffee dessert. For about $2, you can upgrade a side of fries to truffle fries, which is what we did when we ordered the lobster burger. The fries are appealingly thin, fried to a crisp, heavy with truffle taste and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Coupled with a garlic aioli or just some plain ketchup is perfection. The lobster burger is a perfectly cooked patty (medium) with generous chunks of lobster meat from the tail and claws, topped with grilled asparagus on a soft brioche-like bun. This is also only about $15, which is worth it for this sublime dish. I've only ordered the kona coffee dessert once, but I remember a delicious concoction of kona coffee ice cream, fudge, cookie crumbs and a brittle of some sort. Simply divine. I also love the creme brulee sampler, specifically the banana creme brulee. I used to be a fan of the lobster garlic noodles when we first ordered them. However, it seems like they have changed the recipe of the dish. It has a substantially smaller portion of lobster, a sweeter soy-flavor that does not complement the dish well, and the noodles are somewhat soggy and sticky.

So, thinking they close at 12 and not knowing any better, SO and I arrived at 10:50ish (not our usual dinner hour, but he was finishing a paper for finals). The hostess told us the crushing news - last call for food = 11:00 and drinks = 11:20. Our goal was food, and we were desperate. \nThere were no clean tables, and I think she sensed our deep desire to munch, so she went to rush the bussers to get us a table. Score one.\nWe were seated and she said she'd rush our server over to try and get a food order in. Server shows up at 11 on the dot and tells us she can't submit food any longer. I was going to go along with it and just find a drive-thru, but SO fought it/asked that she at least try and sure enough - success! Score two.\nWith our food order in, I ordered the Tinnerman Strawberry beer, and thennnnnnnnn I died and went to heaven. Score three.\nFood arrived pretty quickly and we were very impressed with the portions and flavors. Unfortunately, it wasn't hot like fiyah, but still delicious. We ordered from the happy hour menu - calamari, onion ring tower, and the bearnaise sliders (with normal, to-die-for skinny fries). Seemed like a feast, and I still brought half the onion rings and one slider home. Definitely enough food for us, and definitely enough for us to come back. We even talked about making it a weekly meal - that should tell you a lot. Score four. \nThe icing on the cake - our bill was $23 and some change. We basically spent that same amount two nights before at In N Out. I'm still in shock and awe with that price tag. Ah-may-zing. We will be back.\n\nOh, and our awesome server - Elizabeth! Thanks for the last minute dinner!!! Although we're debating what the hearts on our receipt meant....? I think it's for my \"quick tip\", SO thinks you had a crush on him (but that's just his ego...?)", "name": "Yard House", "rating": 5}, {"index": 2897, "review": "overrated..\nbeer + football = satisfied\n3 stars cuz of food", "name": "Yard House", "rating": 3}, {"index": 2898, "review": "I will give high marks to the beer selection, but the food was horribly bland and uninspiring.

I was frankly too tired to wade through all of it. The place is also rather noisy. There are dozens of televisions showing at least 3 different sporting events at any given time (which means nothing to me). There appeared to be a large crowd of folks looking to meet someone (yay meat market). \n\nFood: My husband had the crab cake hoagie and I had the turkey club. My club had too much mayo and was packed so full it was difficult to eat, but the ingredients were fresh and delicious. My husband really enjoyed his crab cake hoagie. He also had the tomato bisque which he described as super delicious. I had a cup of french onion soup which was good, but by no means the best I've ever had. Before hand we had the \"california roll\" appetizer which the waitress asked if we would like to have chopsticks for. Of course we said yes, until it arrived and we were completely perplexed at how anyone was expected to eat what looked like 6\" wide, 2\" high cake of rice with chopsticks. The sauce was flavorful, but the appetizer was generally more confusing the delicious. My husband ordered one of the 133 beers on tap (seriously....133 - very impressive) while I ordered a Southern Belle (sweet tea vodka, strawberry, and pineapple) which was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. \n\nAmbiance - Loud, but with surprisingly good acoustics. The place felt loud, but I did not have to raise my voice to be heard and didn't have to ask my husband or brother-in-law to repeat themselves. The place has dimmed lights and high backed seats in the booths so there is an opportunity for some intimacy, but the large open bar area and sports games on the TVs makes it casual enough to make it relaxing and a great place to hang out with friends. \n\nService - Our waitress was super friendly and mostly attentive. We had to wait a little while for drink re-fills, but overall she was great. Drink orders took forever - but the place is brand new (four weeks open) and packed even on a Wednesday night so I'll cut them a bit of slack on that point. I'm sure that will improve as the newness of the place wears off a little. \n\nPrice - A little bit overpriced.

And the bar itself is oval-shaped so that was pretty cool. I ordered a Pear Cider to start off with (delish) and my bf got a Stella.

I had ordered a cup of the tomato bisque for my appetizer and ordered the Grilled Shrimp Caeser salad for my entree. The bf ordered clam chowder and a pepperoni and mushroom pizza.

I tasted the clam chowder that my bf had ordered and to me, it had no flavor whatsoever. I was surprised... Maybe my expectations were a little too high?? IDK. So after 10-15 minutes after eating our soups, our entrees came to our table. When our waiter presented my salad to me, my first thought was, \"Wow... my salad looks so plain.\" I remembered reading the description on the menu that the salad would come with toppings and whatnot.

It took 25 minutes for our food to arrive (way too long IMO), and while the food was hot, the cheese had broken down to a gloppy mess of grease covered pasta, bacon, and mushrooms held together with cheese.  Not sure how they make the cheese sauce, but if they do a beschamel like most M&C recipes, then my plate probably cooled and was reheated (the easiest way to break a beschamel this badly), which is not acceptable at $11 a plate.  \n\nMy friend had the turkey burger, which looked good and, by his account, was tasty.  The downside to his plate was that the server gave several options for fries, and never once mentioned there was upcharge for garlic fries.  Server: You may think you can trick a patron into picking the more expensive option but you won't be laughing when I ask for the manager and you have to comp my meal.  Onto the beer....\n\nHouse Tripel is, well, medicinal.  Stay away from it.  To their credit, Yardhouse has about 100 beers on tap, so it should be easy to get a beer that's tasty.  \n\nLast comment is a minor point regarding the TVs at the bar.  If you have TVs facing the window, I suggest purchasing TVs that are matte or have an anti-reflective coating.

I would have liked it better if the artichoke was in the dip, instead of leaving it on the plate for us to peel apart ourselves.\n\nThe burgers are pretty good, although it really does take a lot of work to screw up a burger, but he fries were the best thing on the plate.

The proportion was huge, but it left me feeling like something was missing from the dish. Perhaps putting the chicken on the side instead of adding strips of chicken in the Mac and Cheese would have made it feel more like a meal rather than an appetizer.\n\nNow that I've been there, I can feel a bit more at ease about not going again for a bit, but their Sliders, Truffle Fries, and Onion Ring Tower sound like a great companion to the 100+ beers they have on tap, and even though I was a bit disappointed at their beer selection, it isn't horrible and I have an urge to go again next week just for that.

The service was not given to me, but to the couple sitting next to me. \n\nThe common situation arose where a person was trying to use an expired ID to purchase alcohol in a place where their main source revenue is through alcohol and without it, they lose business. But even more importantly, people lose jobs. Working in customer service myself, I feel like society in general is getting stupider and stupider. I was thinking to myself that this person shouldn't make a big deal if he gets denied since normal people would understand that an expired license is no longer valid. The bartender explains to the couple that he'd have to speak with his manager to try and get it approved and that it would only take a second. Seconds later, a manager comes by and explains that it would be a risk of losing the restaurant's liquor license and that they could not accept the ID. To myself, I thought that was a good enough explanation. I'd understand that my ID is invalid and that I wouldn't even put forth energy in trying to argue my case to every drink I order. However, to the gentleman beside me, he felt as though he should stand up for his date so that he could get her drunk in hopes of getting laid. \n\nHis case continues and suddenly he feels that he has the right to tell the manager how to do her job. He explains how they've purchased items in the past with two credit cards (Someone should let him know that credit cards don't contain birth dates.) and that the manager should look through their records to find that specific one, which in essence would validate his date's expired license. Personally, I'd feel a bit insecure if restaurants had my credit card information that readily available. I know, at least where I work, it's even illegal to keep a customer's e-mail on file.
