[{"index": 0, "review": "New York pizza in California?\n\nThis is the first location when it opened.  And till this day is the best out of the other chains.\n\nThe only special they have is before 2pm is buy two slice of pizza or a slice of pizza with salad and get one free can of soda.  Its not much but when you have two things to finish, having something to wash down helps out.  Plus you can always keep the soda can and recycle it to get 5cents back.  I mean if you really are saving up haha\nIf you forget, they normally remind you.  They have a cardboard sign.  They also have it as a \"Yelp Check-In\" if you forget.  You really can't miss it.\n\nThese pizzas is simply the best.  I cannot stress how amazing these slices are.  They are pricey BUT WELL WORTH THE MONEY.\n\nThe artwork varies from professional to the locals who LOVE this place.\n\nMy favorite part of this place is the Wall of Shame.  You would be surprised how disrespectful people are.  Its ridiculous.  And they should be put on blast.  They had recently taken down some of them, I think because the wall got cluttered with so many people being awful.  Its always nice to look at while you are waiting for pizza to be made.\n\nMy favorite because the special of getting two pizza, is either sharing with my boyfriend, or making my own pizza sandwich.  Yes, pizza sandwich.  Putting two pizza together with the crust facing outward and eating it like a pizza.\n\nMy personal favorite is buffalo slice with combination slice into a sandwich.  Yum.\n\nI wish I didn't live so far.  I only come here if I'm ever close by to the mall or going to my chiropractor.\n\nParking is limited.  And seating is limited.

I heard of this place from a friend, so I thought I'd give it a try. When I got there the place was pretty packed. \n\nIt is tiny, so about 5 people will get it pretty tight. I squeezed in and got in line. The walls are covered with customer photos, artwork, and articles and photos about New York (typical of New York pizza joints). \n\nI ended up ordering an extra large plain cheese. Something else cought my eye though, they had coffee soda!? It was a regular glass bottle for $4, however there prices include tax. \n\nI took everything home and we ate. The pizza was not bad. They warned me about opening the coffee soda slowly, but it still overflowed and made a mess. \n\nOverall, try it, you might like it. I'll have it every now and then.

People are very nice and friendly, I like the fact it's owned by employees.\n\nWe picked two slices each of the margarita, and one with bacon plus 6 garlic knots. Everything was reheated before boxed, we walked out with a lot of food for $26.\n\nAfter arrived home 20 minutes later, we couldn't wait to try them with  beer already chilled in the fridge; we were somewhat disappointed that the pizza didn't have the crispness and were still limp even after being toasted again.

BUT this pizza is totally delicious and always a good choice. You won't be disappointed with the quality and slice sizes. We sat outside at the few small tables because inside is basically standing space. Most customers I noticed bought full pizzas to go, which sounds bougie but delicious.

I was in and out in 2 minutes! \n\nThe only thing preventing a fourth star is the crispness - or lack thereof.

There are some who will settle for a crust that resembles cardboard or even eat cold pizza right out of the fridge. And then, there are those of us who hold higher standards for pizza, recognizing the potential for a well-made crust and sauce. Down at A Slice of New York, us snobs can finally find a satisfying pie. \n\nA sweet, yet slightly tangy sauce topping a crisply thin crust is just how pizza should be. It may not be exactly authentic Italian, but it is a good authentically Italian-American pizza.\nUnless you order the Sicilian style, particular the loaded Meat Lovers inch-thick square, the appearance of your pizza is going to be flat, which adds a nice resemblance to the authentic pizza from Naples. \n\nWhile the regular thin pizza has a delightful crispy crust, the Sicilian's crust has an outer crispness with an enjoyable chewy center. No matter what combination of toppings is on the pizza, the zest from the pepperoni or the oakiness of the mushroom melds well with the flavorful, cheese, sauce, and crust (which are the three main staples to any fine pizza).\n\nA side of garlic knots also makes a fine contribution to any pizza. The drizzle of olive oil and pesto atop the garlic-packed buns only intensify the pleasant chewiness of the bread.  \n\nIf you want your pizza as authentic as possible, the tangy marinara sauce that accompanies the garlic knots also goes nicely with the pizza, which may be my only suggestion  -  more sauce is better sauce. As far as being a genuine New York parlor, the restaurant even offers Devil Dogs, which were only sold on the east coast, to my knowledge.\n\nOf course, they could not call the place A Slice of New York without making the customers feel like they were enjoying a slice of New York city. The interior of the quaint pizzeria has collages with various pictures, souvenirs, and even subway signs from New York. It is too bad that the place is too small to sit in and bask in the d\u00e9cor. Then again, the small size and crowd rushing in is just another touch that reminds us of the crampness of New York.\n\nIt is a good thing there are some tables outside since the place gets flooded with incoming and outgoing patrons around lunch time.

Maybe next time I'll request for a longer blast.\n\nBut the thin slice does fold up real easy, which is the magic behind NY style slices.

Escape from NY? Pfft. Bet they had to escape because they were run out by pitchfork- and torch-wielding people throwing rocks.\n\nTHIS is the least bad NY-style pizza in the Bay area! Sounds like an insult, but believe me, it's a big compliment. Colosseum was the previous title-holder, but has been officially bumped by ASONY.\n\nBorn and bred in NY, I am super picky about my NY and Brooklyn style pizzas (they are not the same thing), and even most places *in* NY and NJ are not up to par in my not-so-humble opinion (message me for my list of favorites).\n\nI've spent years scouring the LA, SF, and Vegas areas for the perfect pie or slice, and while I have found one in Vegas that is shockingly good (once you get over the awkwardness that you are ordering pizza at a Nathan's Hot Dogs) and about a half a dozen in LA that are good enough to scratch the itch (well, I found more than that, but for some reason all the good pizza places have a tendency to go out of business in LA), but despite a year of pounding the pavement in the east bay and peninsula in 2013, I still hadn't found anything remotely acceptable up here.\n\nUntil now.\n\nFor some reason the south bay has produced more candidates actually in the running than any other area. Colosseum even passed the cold pizza breakfast test (i.e., Is it good the next day without reheating?). I was excited to have finally found something that got close, but at the end of the day the texture wasn't quite right and the dough was extremely salty.\n\nThe on-the-nose-named New York Pizza in Palo Alto was also decent if a bit thick and doughy (and the NY-themed Ikea art is cute, if touristy). It's more like NY school cafeteria pizza style than NY pizza joint style.\n\nASONY blows both out of the water. It's by no means perfect, but it's better than even some pizza I've had in Manhattan (and I don't mean Manhattan, KS).\n\nPros:\n\nDough. ASONY gets the dough closer than anywhere else in the bay. Better even than some places in LA that \"import\" the NY tap water which flows from the pristine waters of the upstate NY portion of the Hudson River (before it gets flavored by syringes and offed wiseguys) that I -- as a child through teenager -- called home. More proof the key to a good pie lies not in the water but in skill.\n\nNo complaints about the cheese, but read on to find out about my sauce gripe.\n\nAmbience. The NY memorabilia is more interesting, varied, and personal than the mass-produced NY-themed Ikea art of New York Pizza in Palo.\n\nService. Everyone is really nice. [Not so authentic, but welcome. (Despite the stereotype, NYers are friendly, but they don't do that fake-nice courtesy thing that frankly isn't such a bad thing, and is actually something I miss when I go home.)]\n\nThey take card but if you pay cash they don't charge you tax. (I'm not accusing them of tax evasion; the card price includes card transaction % fees, so I'm sure the easiest way to make the math work without having 2 menu prices for everything is to not charge tax for cash.)\n\nCons: \n\nThe sauce is salty yet on the bland side, IMHO. It doesn't taste like I expected. But at least it's not sweet (sweet pizza = my nemesis).\n\nOne thing I have absolutely not been able to find out west are the traditional specialty pies, like white pizza, white with broccoli, and my childhood favorite, ziti (baked ziti, to be exact). ASONY has white pies, but not the classic white or broccoli white that I miss.\n\nLocation. It's crowded and can be tough to find parking.\n\nIf you want to eat in, it's (authentically) cramped. Like Patsy's in East Harlem (world's 2nd best pie). And they don't like you to take up parking spaces outside (totally understandable, as it isn't fair to other customers trying to get their pizza on, especially in CA where everyone drives everywhere) eating in your car. We get around this by driving around the corner before stopping to devour a slice or two before we finish the rest at home.\n\nThey also don't give you a box unless it's to go.\n\nNot their fault but still a factor: I'm not bigoted against the homeless or mentally ill. This isn't about that. But there's a homeless woman outside who while I was waiting for my pie started yelling \"Take off your hat!\" (a fleece hat with cat ears) and accusing me of wearing it to make fun of her (she does not wear a hat). As a young, lone female who has been a victim of physical attack I was honestly afraid for my safety.\n\nI rate them a 4 because of the few cons above. If they started offering ziti, white, or broccoli pizza I would overlook them and bump them to a 5.\n\nI'd also bump them to a 5 if they improved the flavor of their tomato sauce, but OTOH I don't want to fix what ain't broke, just bland, because if they changed the sauce and it was wrong it would make me sad.\n\nAnd again, I reiterate it's the only pizza joint in the *entire* bay area I've patronized a second (and third, fourth, etc.) time.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 4}, {"index": 92, "review": "ASONY (and boy did it take me a moment to figure out what that stood for) is a small pizza shop that's been on my to visit list for years. Inevitably, I'll forget about it, then my friend rerecommends it, and then cycle repeats. It's very easy to miss this location and there is very minimal parking. We parked on Stevens Creek itself since there was no parking in their small lot. \n\nI should add this disclaimer now: I have never gone to NY nor have I ever had NY style pizza. The pizzas looked good (and the slices pretty large) but I ended up ordering the House Stromboli. It is made to order, so expect to wait 10-15 min for it.\n\nThe employees were very nice and the interior unique, though there was not much seating overall. We were able to snag a table outside, but we were ready to take our food to go if there was no seating. \n\nThe House Stromboli was warm, and when I cut it in half (I anticipated taking home half) lots of liquid came out, making parts of the dish soggy. Likely the liquid was from all the vegetables inside. To be honest, it was really hard to eat it since it got soggy and started to fall apart the more I ate it. However, the flavors were good and it was great to dip it in marinara sauce occasionally. \n\nI took the other half back home. When I got the munchies, I tried it without heating it back up (I actually like cold pizza, blasphemy I know). It held together much better since I mopped up the excess liquid before taking it home.

Together they took a total of around 10-15min. Meanwhile another customer came to my right within that 10minutss and while I was there waiting the cashier turned to the other customer who arrived only a few minutes earlier to take his order before mine. The reason is that he was in the right line to order by the slice and I was in the wrong line...\n\nSo a couple of thoughts... 1) no clear signs between takeout orders and orders by the slice. I learned today that to order by the slice i should have approached the counter by the right. So if you do go to this place... know that. 2) this bugged me the most... while I was there standing for 10min... can you tell me that this line is just for take out? Or better yet not just skip over my order altogether while the other customer wanted me to go first since he knew I was standing there for a while... \n\nMeh..  no real harm, just working in food service during college, some care and clarity would have helped in this situation.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 2}, {"index": 145, "review": "As a die hard Cicero's fan, I was wary at the prospect of a new pizza place in San Jose. I am happy to report however, that I did not leave a Slice of New York disappointed! \n\nI came here on a weekday at lunchtime, and I was surprised to see that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be! They sell both whole pies and pizza by the slice (selections are dependent on whats coming out of the oven). While the slices are already pretty inexpensive, they offer some good deals (a free drink w/purchase of 2 slices etc.). \n\nI went with the classic margherira and my group ordered some garlic knots as well. The pizza was incredibly flavorful, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. I loved the fact that they used whole garlic cloves, as it really elevated the flavor! The crust was perfect, and although it was super thin, it really supported the toppings well.  \n\nThe garlic knots were okay, a little bit too doughy for my taste. \n\nWhile the location is quite small, they really do a good job of making you feel as if you are in New York! The inside is covered from top to bottom with NY street signs, posters, and various other pieces of work. Seating is limited to a few stools on the inside and about 4 small tables outside, so it might be difficult for a large party. \n\nI will definitely be returning as I would love to try some of their creations that weren't available the day I went in!", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 4}, {"index": 146, "review": "Talk about a great New York pizza in California.

While they said our pizzas would take 30-ish minutes to make, we arrived a little bit early since traffic was light. Once we walked in, there was a family in front of us and another man for pick up, but the line moved fairly fast and the girl at the register was friendly (and also shout out to the guy who answered the phone who was also very friendly and efficient.) I guessed that this was their rush hour because the phone was ringing off the hook and it was obvious all the workers were going full force. It was after all a Sunday around 4pm AND Game of Thrones premiere day. The smell inside was heavenly and the pizza by the slice they had in the case looked DELICIOUS, but sadly me and my friend still had a drive home until I could finally get the cheesy, oozy, goodness in my mouth. \n\nOnce our other friends came to join, we propped open the two pizza boxes and went to town. We ordered one pizza with pepperoni and spicy Italian sausage, and the other with smoked ham and pineapple. My first bite was of the latter. One of the criteria I have for pizza is if it handles 'the fold'. You know when you don't have a plate but your damn hungry so you try to eat the pizza without making a mess? With one simple squeeze of my hand the pizza held it's shape and didn't droop down at the tip which is A++. Second criteria was the cheese stretch and the topping flavor, which TOTALLY held up to my standards. And last but not least, the crust. The crust has that perfect slightly chewy give to it from the top, but still a bit of a crusty part at the bottom. I had like 4 slices that night and was happily satisfied and honestly pretty surprised that this place is like a small shop on the west side.

Photos of the signs referenced can be found at the bottom of this post. \n\nMy name is William Eagle (known around the shop as Weagle), a Shift Lead and 4-year veteran of A Slice of New York. \n\nWe take it very seriously and personally when we receive a one-star review, so I'm here to try and offer some perspective on the issue. The \"service guy\" that requested you not use a box next time was the owner of the establishment. After knowing Kirk for over four years, to hear that he was rude and disrespectful to his customers sounds wildly out of his character. We apologize if it was taken with any malice or ill will, but I can assure you that was not the intention of the interaction. \nAs with any successful business, we understand the perspective of the customer. 'We're paying for it, and the boxes and everything is included in the cost right? What does it matter if we take it to go or not?' While this maybe true, as a small business we cannot allow such waste with good conscience. It's not good for the business. It's not good for the environment. At other corporate entities (McDonalds, Round Table, etc.), they may be able to afford to waste at the capacity that they do, but as a small business we cannot afford to operate the same way. \n\nOur owner felt the need to vocalize our request to save boxes because the many signs we've placed around our shop seem to go unnoticed. I've shared some pictures of our signs as well as the outcome of multiple 'unused' boxes in the trash. We have a sign posted on the front door as well as a sign right in front of the register requesting more consciousness when deciding whether to eat 'for here' or 'to go'. \n\nAgain, we meant no harm when requesting the use of plates instead of a box. We are simply trying to stay sensitive to the harsh realities of operating a small business in the Bay Area as well as the harsh realities of our Earth's environment. \n\nI hope this post helped to clear the air and offer our perspective and some transparency into our business practices.

I asked what was popular--he pointed to the Margherita, so we got one slice of that and one of the mushroom, and he popped them both in the oven for us. They were pretty good, decent thin crust that was soft & pliable (not just the edge crust, but the base below the toppings), the sauce on the Margherita was nice and garlicky, but the cheese and toppings were just painfully ordinary.\n\nThinking that our disappointment was possibly due to the fact that our slices were reheated, I went in afterwards and waited for a fresh slice of the pepperoni, sausage, & jalape\u00f1o pizza that had just come out.

(the owner of a ASONY) and I began to wonder again - obviously, I was much too sober at the time I read the note ;-)\n\nKirk's completely good-natured contention was that our test was flawed because we were comparing apples to oranges; Bibo's typically uses the \u00be baked method for their slices, while ASONY cooks their by-the-slice pies all the way through before putting them out for display.  ASONY also typically pre-makes some of their most popular combos for by-the-slice pies, while Bibo's just uses a basic pie and adds toppings to match the order after the fact.  \n\nAfter going back and forth for a while, Kirk and I decided that we owed it to ourselves to set up Round 2 of this now Epic comparison.  When the dust settled, we had agreed that the venue would actually be at ASONY, and that Kirk himself would weigh in with his thoughts on the two pizzas.  It was further decided that the main thrust of this 2nd comparison would be done using pies exactly as normal consumers would most likely experience them - using toppings the way they wanted them to end up, and baking them 100% through, then taking them home and eating them out of the box.\n\nFor the record, I bow my hat to Kirk, who is not only a man who knows the pizza trade inside and out, but who is also a total Kamikaze for uniform testing methods!  For the purpose of this test, he stocked some 20\" boxes (because that's the size pie that Bibo's sells), and arranged with me to take the ASONY pie out of the oven at exactly the same time that we picked up the Bibo's pie; he even had one of his staff stash the ASONY pie their car to more closely duplicate the condition of the Bibo's pie.\n\nOne last bit of background before I cut to the chase.  We also got 2 slices from Bibo's and 2 slices from ASONY; both were pepperoni and mushrooms.  This we expected would yield a different result than in our first test, because Bibo does the \u00be bake with no toppings and then adds them; ASONY bakes a special pie with pepperoni and mushrooms just for slices because that combo is so popular.\n\nIt's time for the bottom line - drum roll please! \n\n- For pies directly from their ovens to your table, go with ASONY; for slices, go with Bibo's \u00be bakes, and finish them on a pizza stone.\n- For the best darn NY style pizza experience ANYWHERE, go with a slice of Sicilian from ASONY; their Meatlovers' is ridiculous, and a single slice could dispatch an entire Roman Legion into a blissful food coma.\n\nLet's keep in context the fact that both of these NY style pizza restaurants are world-class - I'd match them up against any pizza joint both West AND East of the Hudson River.  If NY style pizza is what you crave, then you'll be a happy camper at either place.\n\n[The End]\n\nTasting notes:\n\n- Comparing just the flavor of the dough used in both places, I have to give the nod to Bibo's.  It's chewier, and a little sweeter.  That said both crusts are exceptional!\n- \"Independent suspension\" (a bit of my personal pizza jargon; by that I mean how well does the pizza stands up to a good cross-section of toppings without drooping or becoming soggy) clearly goes to ASONY.\n- The cheese and spice combination used by Bibo's ranks a notch or two higher in my book.  I like the flavor of the cheese and the gestalt taste better.\n- When considering the meat topping flavors (especially the pepperoni) ASONY clearly comes out on top.\n- When reheated a second and third time, ASONY retained their flavor and \"independent suspension\" better.\n- When we examined it closely, it was obvious that the pie we got from Bibo's wasn't their best work; the dough was not completely uniform, and it was thicker in the middle than at the ends.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 5}, {"index": 445, "review": "This is the Best pizza around!

There were a ton of meats on this pizza, including pepperoni, salami, sausage and apparently meatballs? But I don't really remember that part. They also sprinkle little chunks of garlic on the pizza which brings more flavor and texture to the pizza. \n\nI love how NY style pizza is thinner and it's always fun eating it all folded up.

I love all kinds of pizza.  Chicago, New York, Sicilian, Papa Johns, Mama Celeste, pizza rolls, whatever!  I don't want to get in the silly debate.  If it tastes good, that's what matters!

Different, but still fantastic!  The spicy sausage is also good, as is the Sicilian meatlovers.  As for the rest of the menu, the garlic knots are really good, but may be a little \"doughy\" for some.  The calzone is probably one of the best I've had and the stromboli is just as good.\n\nIf you're looking for dessert, they have delicious cannolis, but they're maybe a little too sweet.  However, if you ask them to not fill it up with so much cream, then you should be good to go.  They also have tiramisu, which I haven't tried yet, and also Drake's cakes.  At $2 a pop for the Drake's, you might just fill yourself up with another slice instead.  =)\n\nAlways a great meal here.  The service is fast and friendly (for the most part) and the food is consistently terrific!  However, keep in mind that the inside \"dining area\" is small.  It consists of only a few stools.  They have some tables outside, but again, those can fill up fast.  My recommendation is to get a pie or two to go.  Unfortunately, they don't deliver.

The guy with the red beard at the register was less than friendly and it was the worst, most expensive pizza I've ever had. We ordered a large 1/2 veggie, 1/2 pepperoni, mushroom and pineapple pie to go, and 3 garlic knots and were charged $37.  For $30+ we got a thin, greasy, soggy crust that had absolutely NO flavor to it (except for the heal of the crust which was rock hard). There was only 3-4 slices of pepperoni per large slice (wholly insufficient!!!!), and NO Mushrooms on either half of the pie! (We were charged $3 per topping ON HALF THE PIE, and then not get the Full serving with one of them missing entirely? That is unacceptable!)\n\nWhen I tried to reheat a leftover slice today, even putting it into a skillet to crisp up the crust did not work! All I got was a burned inedible slice that was still completely soggy throughout.\n\nThe garlic knots were good as was the sauce that went on them, but I don't think we got the same sauce on the pizza (which also sucked).\n\nNeither I or my friends will ever come here for a pizza again, and it's not worth the trip just for garlic knots.\n\nA complete waste of money. A Dominos two pizza deal would have given more food for half the price and would have tasted 1000% better (and I don't personally like Dominos). Frozen pizza is better than the pie we got last night!\n\nTrying to call to complain was a waste of time. It kept going to voicemail, last night and today. If this is the best representation of authentic New York pizza, I'm never going to New York.\n\n2/24/15 - UPDATE\n\nWow. What a righteous and condescending response.  FYI, we were there at about 9:30pm or so. It did not appear terribly busy; there were a few customers there sitting, and only one other person in line behind us, and 3 employees were just standing around and talking the entire time that we waited for  the pie and the knots to be packed up.  We only live 2 miles away, so it was only in the \"steamy\" box for 6-7 minutes. I usually get pepperoni, pineapple and mushroom pizzas and I've had them delivered by Dominos (not my preference), Round Table, Stuft and even gotten them for take out from many places, including Premier Pizza (from the other side of town), all of which took 30 minutes or more from oven to destination, and they never turned out so soggy. AND the leftovers did crisp back up when reheated in a skillet.  \n\nYou compare yourself to Little Ceasar's (the WORST pizza on the planet, that I haven't eaten in 25+ years ) and Costco (which is possibly the greasiest I've ever seen, but their crust was still less soggy than yours.)  Fitting.  And no one I've ever had pizza from (including restaurants in San Francisco and Chicago), were as expensive as yours and yet, they manage to put a sufficient amount of each topping on, and some of them use true quality ingredients like fresh pineapple, not canned.\n\nYour excuses still don't explain the lack of flavor either. I now understand why the cashier had a less-than-customer-service-friendly attitude. It obviously comes from management's example.   The only employee who displayed a smile and good attitude was the young dark-haired woman who was packing our food. \n\nAs a side note, It wasn't until today that I made the connection that you have another store in Sunnyvale.  Last summer and fall I tried pizza at that store, twice, during meetings for an organization I'm involved with, and had similar experiences with \"meh\" pizza both times, and less than friendly employees, (I would even say \"nasty\" on the 2nd visit). I wasn't the one to pay for those, so never really said anything.  I just know that the others in the organization felt the same way and everyone agreed we would not be going there again.   But even though the pizza there wasn't particularly great either, It was still better than what we got the other night. \n\nSo apparently I was mistaken and this wasn't my first visit to SoNY, so \"three strikes, you're out.\"  There is no way in ____ we will be back and I'd be inclined to consider disputing the charge to the credit card if I had paid with one.  Just because...    \n\nYou really need to call Robert Irvine from Restaurant: Impossible for help. I do find it amusing that the other negative reviews on here pretty much say the same things. and I am truly shocked that you've got as many good reviews has you have.\n\nAs for taking a picture: That's a really good idea that I wish I'd thought of.

I have no clue, since I've never traveled to New York. Hopefully someday soon I'll have an answer for you. But in the mean time I've already managed to visit this place twice, and each trip was a completely different experience (rating).\n\nMy friend Joey was telling me how sensational A Slice of NY (http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C4Udo7jGf8gI07luVlW9OA/l)  was and how I must try it.  With the amount of enthusiasm he showed, I was eager for some pizza. On my first visit I ended up ordering two slices, a Meatlover and a Hawaiian. The slices were sent to the oven for heating and when they came out they were only lukewarm. Nothing special about the pizza at all, and I failed to understand why my friend was so in love with A Slice of NY. I considered asking them to re-heat the slices, but because of my hungry stomach and how packed the place was I decided against it. I later looked this place on Yelp and was surprised with the high praise they received. I decided I would give them another try. At this moment, you were a mere 2.5 stars in my books.\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago, and this time I came with Michelle. Instead of ordering individual slices, we ordered a whole pizza. We decided with the Rockefellar Center Pizza (http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f_C_wnZdQrNkX3jnbdfA6g/l) and also an order of Garlic Knots(http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wv22ttwvYBrfMraAXkxN_A/l). Was this the same place I previously order those two slices? \n\nThe Rockefellar Center pizza (4 stars) was simply delicious and is a meat lover's dream come true. It consists of pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, meatballs, and chopped garlic. The meat was extremely plentiful and the chopped garlic offers a burst of flavor. This was so much better in comparison to my first visit.\n\nThe Garlic Knots (3 stars) didn't quite live up to the hype. They were just alright, not so heavenly or out of this world as many people made them out to be.\n\nSummary (3.75 Stars): This place stays open late until midnight, except on Mondays (closed on Monday)!

This review no way reflects the quality of the food but rather the service that I received yesterday.\n\nI called in at 12:40PM and placed an order for pickup (large pizza).  The person on the phone  told me it will take 30 min so we got there around 1:10 PM and it still wasn't ready so my friends decided to get 2 slices while we waited.  \n\nAfter 20 additional minutes (it was now after 1:30 PM), I went inside and waited in the \"Pick-up Line\".  I waited and waited  while the person working on the register was helping the 1 person in front of me in the \"pick up line\" and then other people in line who were waiting to order by the slice.  I finally got upset and cut him off when he offered to help the 3rd customer in the \"Order\" line when he noticed me there for at least 5-10 minutes by saying \"Is the large pizza for xx ready?  I've been waiting for over 40 min for my pizza.\"  His answer was \"Oh, it just came out of the oven.\" and no apology or anything. I thought to  myself \"You could've told me that my order wasn't ready yet instead of making me wait in line for all that time for your attention.\"\n\nTo the manager: The young man who worked on the register on Sunday from 1-2 pm is clearly in need of some customer service training.  He had no interest in helping out when I was clearly waiting for him to help me. (I know you have video surveillance in your store, please take a look at it).  Also, if he's not happy to work at the register (which was very obvious by his non-attentive attitude), then he should really be in the back where he won't have to deal with customers.

I made a stop here to try their pizza.The place itself is really easy to find.. But I imagine parking would be a problem.. Especially during their busy hours.

I originally got it togo but after receiving the hot sizzling pizza on my hands, we decided to enjoy it on the table outside since it was pretty cool outside. All the pizza turned out great, I would totally recommend the pesto and chicken. What I like so much about the pizzas here are their thin and ever so crispy crust.

However, I lived in New York for a while, and I don't think it's greasy enough to qualify as \"New York style.\"  In New York, the pizza is so greasy that it collapses unless you either eat it with two hands, or fold it with one hand.  I actually like pizza a little less greasy than true New York style, but the pizza here is too dry and stiff: that was the case with both the pepperoni slice and the margherita slice I tried.  But still very good thin-crust style.\n\nThe cannoli was OK: I'm not a cannoli expert, but the shell was a bit too crunchy and hard, as if it were design to endure the cross-country trip from New York to California, and the filling was a bit too sweet and too smooth.  I slightly prefer the cannoli sold at La Biscotteria in Redwood City, which has a lighter shell and an almost gritty filling.\n\nI do not recommend the garlic knots; they appear to be made with regular pizza dough, so they are too dense inside.  You get a little container of pizza sauce to dip them in, which really softens them up, but I would prefer garlic knots that are light and fluffy in the middle, such as those sold at Specialty's Bakery.\n\nThey sell Manhattan Special Coffee Soda (see my photo).

Enjoy.\n\nDear Archie G., \n\nHi. I am new to Yelp here. I was looking for pizza joints and noticed that A Slice of New York averages 4.5 stars after nearly 1,000 reviews. The pizza didn't look very good in the photos and when I tried it, it was kind of gross. How is this high rating possible? Am I missing something here?\n\n-Confused in Cupertino\n\nDear Confused,\n\nYou are not missing anything. Simply stated, the pizza at A Slice of New York (ASONY) is not that good. But there is a long and short answer as to why the rating stays so high. \n\nShort Answer: A Slice of New York features two star pizza and five star customer service. \n\nLong Answer: A Slice of New York is easily the most overrated restaurant on all of Yelp. Don't let the sheep on here fool you and lead you to mediocre pizza that features barely any cheese, bland sauce, and extremely greasy toppings that I wouldn't even feed to my dog. \n\nThe pictures on Yelp pretty much tell the story. The slices are not visually stimulating and the pizza generally looks cheap and disgusting. But the people that post them on here want to make us believe that those crappy looking slices are making us salivate. Right. The last time I had to suspend disbelief that much was when Donna Martin, of \"Beverly Hills 90210,\" became a runway model even though she was not very tall or pretty, and was generally hideous. \n\nEven with all of that said, ASONY is some of the better New York style pizza I have tried. Unlike real New York style pizza, ASONY uses real mushrooms not that canned crap you find all over the east coast. Also, the crust is actually pretty good. It's thin and crispy. Unfortunately, everything that dresses the slice up is mediocre and ill-fitting. It's like dating a girl with a super nice body that dresses in super loose fitting clothes from Walmart.\n\nAs much as I find the pizza here mediocre, the place does have some bright spots. The meatball sandwich can be pretty good (if the cooks ensure the meatballs are warm). The garlic knots are decent side dish. Also, the cannolis are a tasty little dessert for two. And the staff here is remarkable. They are friendly, energetic (even late at night), and offer up amazing customer service. \n\nSpeaking of customer service, it's amazing in and out of the restaurant. The owner ASONY, Kirk, goes out of his way to make sure you are satisfied customer. He'll send you a little Yelp message trying fix any problem that he can. He clearly cares about this little restaurant and the product he is putting out there. And people, especially Yelpers, appreciate that and hence, the rating stays (unusually) high.\n\nIf it weren't for Kirk's continual attempts to make things right with me, this rating might have hovered in the 1 to 2 star range. In fact, I almost feel bad issuing a 3 star rating to a small pizza place that has such a hardworking, driven owner that strives for customer satisfaction. But in the end, it's a pizza joint and the pizza just isn't that good (to me). Then again, it is hard being smarter than everybody else (on Yelp). \n\nKidding. Well, sort of.\n\nBut let this be a lesson to small restaurant owners out. Great customer service can go a long way. I may not come here for the pizza, but occasionally I do stop by and spend my hard earned money on other items, especially the cannolis.\n\nWell, Confused in Cupertino, I hope this helps answer your question.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 3}, {"index": 1117, "review": "My friend kept talking about this place, so I finally got a chance to try it out last week and it lived up to the hype.

They don't have off days here, and that's a sign of a good pizza recipe.  The slices are NY size which is nice.  The sauce is properly seasoned, with just hints of herbs of spices, nothing too heavy handed.  The ratio of cheese to crust is also on point, with a nice clean taste.  Also a plus is the fact that there's not as much grease as one would expect from a thin crust slice.  When it comes to NY slices, one can only really judge on plain (cheese) slices, and pepperoni slices.

Naturally, A Slice of New York was my first choice, but I was sadly displeased with my entire experience....\n\nI called in my order so it would be ready when I got there. The women who picked up the phone was very short with me and did not seem to understand English very well. I had to repeat myself several times before she understood what I wanted, and when we were in agreement of what the order was she simply said \"thats too many ingredients\" okay.....so I asked \"is that not okay?\" and she just said well \"its just too many\" okay....so I asked \"should I change my order?\" and she replies \"no\" Very, unnecessary comment then, but whatever. I was ready to forgive the unpleasant phone exchange. She asked for my name and then told me the pizza would be ready in 25 minutes.\n\n25 minutes later, I arrived to pick up my order, eager for my yuummy pizza! But....no one helped me for at least 10 minutes. I was standing at the cash register, staring at the employees who were doing something, apparently, more important. When someone finally stopped whatever they were doing to help me, he couldn't find my order. It turns out the women on the phone wrote down Liz instead of Paige as the name for the order. \n\nThen to top off the whole experience...and extend my wait, the pizza wasn't made correctly. They forgot to put on the tomatoes that I had requested. So the guy just threw tomatoes on my pizza really quick and gave it to me. I'm not sure how they usually put tomatoes on pizza...but I expected mine to be baked and warm with the pizza. After all the waiting and confusion, I just wanted to get the heck out with my pizza....so I didn't bother saying anything. My boyfriend was displeased with how the tomatoes were just thrown on as an afterthought. \n\nThe only reason why I'm putting this down to 3 stars and not lower, is because I still love the pizza.

That assured me the pizza was good if there were that many people stopping by for pizza already...\n\nAs I sat on the stool I got to take in the total atmosphere of A Slice of New York...everything from the New York Subway decor, to the \"Wall of Shame\" to the outstanding customer service. Each and every guest whether or not they were regulars were warmly greeted. Everyone waiting for their food were offered free garlic knots drenched with their marinara sauce...I throughly enjoyed my free sample wishing we were offered 4 knots instead of 2 LOL\n\nMore time elapsed and the owner asks us what we were waiting for and we told him we were waiting on a Rockefeller. He also asked us if we wanted to enjoy some slices there and we anxiously nodded out heads since we were starving and the smell and sights of there pizza \nwas intoxicating,\n\n10 minutes later our pizza was finally ready, let me tell you it was a good looking pie....every centimeter of it was carefully covered in thin slices of pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, and garlic. I dressed my slice up with their hot sauce and garlic powder and it instantly became my new favorite pizza joint.\n\nIf you are looking for a quick stop, great -tasting- huge slices of New York Style pizza with a \"Everybody Knows Your Name\" atmosphere...you need to pave your way to  A Slice of New York!!\n\nP.S. They're Root beer-Creme Granita is also a winner!!!", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 4}, {"index": 1243, "review": "After seeing this place so highly yelp rated and having a good friend that swears by it, this has been on my list to try for a while. After a trip to Macy's for new pots and pans to outfit our remodeled kitchen (yeay!)we finally made the stop here. And I'm so glad we did. Even though I'm on a lucky fabulous food eating streak lately, in general I don't give out 5 stars too often. \n\nHighlights:\n- Atmosphere: shortest trip to New York. It's a super small shop with NY subway signs, maps, and other native markers all around. Being next to a blues club it can get pretty loud so you almost get that chaotic city feel. Even staff has that NY vibe: a group of guys playful yelling back and forth to each other with their accents and all.\n- Pepperoni and sausage slice: are you kidding me???? Another food item I'm tempted to make up a word for but since I've been watching this season's Bachelor I'll say it's BRILLIANT! I love pepperoni but move over pepperoni, the sausage was the star here. The small slices of sausage had the hybrid look of grated cheese and thin sliced onion. I've never seen it prepared that way and it was so so tasty and full of flavor as well as crispy awesomeness. (I watch a lot of How I Met Your Mother as well). I dig the average misshaped circular hunks of sausage I'm used to, but this takes the cake.. or should I say pie ? ;-) Magnificent! \n- Margarita: delightful. Maybe the shy, polite, graceful, but can hold her own partner to the bold sausage and pepperoni slice. I'd say maybe your Charlotte as opposed to a Samantha (can't wait for the Sex and the City movie). She had pieces of basil on top which was pretty and tasty as well as surprise pieces of chopped garlic underneath the cheese. The tomato was light and refreshing to round out all the necessary margarita flavors. Each ingredient was noticeable and sang on its own but made the greatest music together. (I'm also into American Idol lately.) \n- Thin crust: on both of the above it's crisp with the perfect amount of softness and lightness at the same time. My favorite kind of crust. :-) Makes me want to dance! (I TiVo Ellen's show daily.) Oh and all are heated up in the cool oven so they come out all warm and steamy!\n- Sicilian slice: I have to say I wasn't drawn to this one but it was surprisingly impressive. It's a mongo puffy square slice with crunch outside and airy chewiness inside. You do get a lot more of the tomato sauce and cheese on this on compared to the average slices. Kind of like the awkward, bit pudgy, in your face, but endearing friend you can't help but find yourself loving like William Shatner's character on Boston Legal.\n- Something the hub and I agree on! We don't always match tastes or he doesn't agree with my ratings, but this one gets 5 stars from both of us. And as a bonus, this really is his realm and he's super tough on judging pizza. It's one of his main 4 food groups: others being fried chicken, steak/hamburgers, and french fries. It killed me--ok maybe not killed me but severely injured so maybe I'd need attention of one of the McSomething men from Grey's Anatomy--when he thought my absolute favorite pizza in Wisconsin was just ok.  :-(\n- Open late: til midnight even on a Sunday so they're ready to feed your cravings at any time! Love how it's fun and will always be there for you like Jim is to Pam on the Office.\n- Garlic knots: went back 5/25/08 and had these.  These are the Hiro of Heros: loveble, good intentioned, strong, and a glue that keeps everything together. Chewy brown doughy super garlicy with a dollop of pesto on top. Sounds standard but it's so so SO much better than that. Move over breadsticks or pizza buddies, there's a new kid in town!\n\nLowlights (my flip side to highlights):\n- Not too much sitting space: inside small counter space for 4 on one side and can fit another 2 on other right side. Outside a few small tables and outside ledge counter space.\n- Parking: in front is a zoo with a very few available in a mini lot right in front and a few spaces on the street in front of that.\n- At opening may be a bit low on slices and have to wait a bit--but it's well worth it!\n- To me, just a wee bit greasy but the hub says pizza needs to have just the right amount greasy to be good.\n\nAll were phenomenal, but If I was on a deserted island (yeay to Lost episodes being back on) and had to pick a winner for this challenge (gotta love Top Chef!), it'd be the pepperoni and sausage. I know I'll crave that and come back for more! \n\nP.S. This crazy TV theme wasn't planned--it just came to me while writing.

You know, the spot you can depend on to provide sustenance for an important game or a post-guys'-night-out meal to suck up all that alcohol. The South Bay has left me with much to be desired with pizza, so like most of you, we turned to Yelp for guidance. My girlfriend found this place as she deems most high review-count/highly-rated food places deemed worthy of trial. So on a random Wednesday evening, we decided to try this even more random pizza-shop in Santa Clara.\n\nUpon pulling into this place, we had trouble finding parking so we ended up parking at the Jiffy Lube two doors down. There's a mini parking lot with a few spots and some street parking available, but you may need to look elsewhere for parking. The restaurant itself is really quite small - as in the kitchen is 5 times bigger than the seating area. Word of advice: call in your order ahead of time and pick it up to go. Now, Slice of New York does its best to be authentically New York so you'll see the d\u00e9cor with New York subway maps and various signs and posters. It's pretty unique for South Bay and did bring back some memories from my visit to New York. Just know that if you're a Yankees-hater like moi, you'll need to swallow your tongue for the few minutes you pay and pick up your pizza.\n\nFood: As you can guess, the pizza here is New York-style. The slices are about average-sized for NY-style and weren't as greasy as I've had before. I thought the ingredients were quite good and definitely better than what I've had here in California. Highlight of the night? The cannolis... My goodness these were delicious! I've tried many cannolis and these were some of the best I've ever had. The pastry part is crunchy yet still flakey, while the filling includes chocolate chips and is extremely smooth and not overly sweet. Probably some of the best mascarpone I've ever had.\n\nOverall, I thought the food here was excellent, especially with the lack of quality NY-style pizza places in the Bay Area.

As someone who has had many a slice of \"NY Style\" Pizza walking the streets of Manhattan...this is not close. Basically, I think the owners view \"NY Style\" pizza as a way to skimp on ingredients. Yes, \"NY Style\" pizza has a very thin crust, but it is also has a good helping of toppings - even if it's just a pepperoni and cheese slice. The Slice of NY pizza is so light on toppings it makes a Domino's pizza slice look like a virtual deep dish pie. I know they are not exactly \"NY Style\" but head over to Pleasure Point and get a slice from Pleasure Pizza, or at least one from Pizza My Heart (they are in Cupertino and at the airport) if you want to see how slices are done right.\nSecond, the service - it's simply awful. The last two visits I literally walked out after being in the store for close to 5 minutes and not even being acknowledged. The last visit there were actually 6 guys behind the counter (and only 3 \"customers\") and yet it was still more important for the cashier to chat idly about welfare benefits with his buddy then to say so much as \"be with you in a minute\". Here's a helpful hint, put a stop watch behind the counter and ask your employees to at least verbally acknowledge  a customer within 4 minutes of their entering the store - it's really not that hard. It wasn't very busy when I visited but getting the help's attention seems like a real chore...helping customers does not seem to be very high on their \"to do\" list.

This review is based on how satisfied I feel after the pizza. Does it make my mouth water when I think about it? Do I have the urge to come back the next day?\n\nI got two slices of a pizza with pepperoni, salami, mushroom, and black olives. At $4.25 a slice-- this is not cheap. The cheapest slice you can get is a plain ol' cheese at $3.25. Back when I lived in San Diego, I could get a slice of cheese for $2 at one of my favorite pizza stops. Or go crazy and order a Sicilian pepp pizza for $2.75. Instead, I have to pay at least $1 more here. But you can't place a value on good pizza. So was it worth it?\n\nSize of slices: Honestly, I've had larger slices (at least 20% larger) at other pizza stops. They're pretty big compared to slices mass-manufactured by Papa Johns. But against the big dawgs, $4.25 / slice is by no means a bargain.  I've seen bigger from other hole in the wall places. 3/5\n\nDough: The dough is very chew throughout. It's strong enough to hold the toppings and cheese (very important). It's foldable. But it lacks any kind of crispy and flaky texture though. IMO, it's actually too doughy for my taste. Low amounts of grease below the dough. Is that authentic? maybe they're catering towards left coast tastes.  3/5\n\nToppings/cheese: Plenty of tasty meat on this pizza. But honestly, are you really getting everything you're paying for? To be honest, No I don't think so. Sure, the meats are fresh. Mushrooms had some punch. Salami was quite good. \n\nBut the cheese was lacking that chewy and solid texture that I love so much about NY slices. Gotta improve the cheese. Add more cheese. Or change up your distributor of cheese. It's just not there. And there's not quite enough. And where can I get some ricotta? 3/5\n\nSauce: \nI don't give a rat's ass what other Yelpers have been raving about OMG good toppings! or OMG what a huge slice! as their sole basis for rating this place 5 stars. What separates pizza shops is the sauce. That's it. You gotta have a delicious sauce or else it's still a pretty mediocre pizza. Fortunately, the sauce here is very good--but not awesome.\nThe tomato sauce is surprisingly neutral, with a slight bit of punch towards the back end of your mouth as you swallow it. This place doesn't lather it on huge. In fact, I might suggest they lather on a bit more.  And unlike commercialized pizza places, the sauce is NOT sweet (a huge +). Very inoffensive. Very even. Goes very well with the toppings. Slight hint of garlic. 4/5\n\nOverall: Pizza is good, but not excellent. I was starving when I walked in to grab pizza and I expected to be overcome with a foodgasm as soon as I had my first bite-- didn't happen. Dare I say, it could use a bit of more kick in flavor?\n\nTips for improvement: \nA slice of NY needs fresher pizza slices on their shelves. Re heated pizza tastes awesome, but I sure as hell can taste the difference between pizza made 30 minutes ago vs. pizza made 3 hours ago. \n\nLonger re-heat times. Honestly, the pizza wasn't piping hot when I got in my to go box. Pizza needs to be scalding my hands when I get it. \n\nDrop the price. Maybe this is typical price for a slice in the Bay Area, but $8.50 for two slices and no drink is a rip-off-- especially if I'm not craving it two hours later. Drop the cheese slice down to $2.75. Make a combination $3.50 and I might just stop in more often. \n\n\nPros:\n- great sauce\n- probably best slices in the bay\n- love the decor here. staff is nice too (is that authentic? nope)\n\nCons:\n- over-priced (seriously how are people saying this place is cheap???)\n- mediocre dough\n- stick it in the oven longer\n\nFinally. People It's an insult to compare ASONY to Costco pizza. ASONY is far from the best NY style pizza I've had, but it's light years ahead of Costco pizza; even if it's 2x the price.\n\n\nedit: Thanks Kirk for clarifying on the meatlovers and re-heating times.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 3}, {"index": 1339, "review": "I am an east coast transplant, and this is one of the few, if not the only, pizza I will eat around here.

My best friend was totally against \"New York\" in general cause he hated the fact I was going to move there, but he had to give the pizzas a try, well I forced him. \n\nFirst of all, had to try to garlic knots. He LOVED them. I love them. They serve it with this warm marinara sauce and my goodness it is heaven in your mouth. Then the pizza came. We ordered the Bensonhurst which had seasoned chicken breast, pesto, fresh mushrooms and garlic. OMG let's use his words to describe it...\"Orgasm in your mouth.\" It was very delicious. And truly, it was a Slice of New York. \n\nThe cannolis for dessert are actually popular as well. My best friends hates anything sweet, so I ordered one and he tried some. He disliked. I said it was okay. Odd tasting. Mix between cream and ice cream? I don't know what it was. But I guess people love them. \n\nAnyway, the environment has a great feel to it. Definitely puts you in the atmosphere of NYC.  TINY TINY parking lot, you must result to street parking. The place is SMALL. Barely any seating, meant for order on the go. The place is decorated with everything you can think of that represents New York. One of my favorite places to go in to. \n\nThis place is a must try if you're strap on cash to go all the way to NYC to try the real stuff. This is the close you can get in San Jose.

Flavor and balance of sauce-to-cheese-to-bread was nice.  Oil dripping off the pizza was expected and welcome.  The bread struck me as a bit chewier than I'm used to from the NY pizzas I've had.  I'm thinking maybe this had to do with the slices being reheated and then sitting through my 10 minute drive back home.  hmm...\n\nFor now, I'll have to give this place 3 stars as it doesn't bring anything too special to the table for me *yet*.

Initially I wanted a slice of pizza since I didn't get a chance to try any when I was actually in New York, but the pictures posted by the register changed my mind.  My friend and I split a stromboli (thanks to a worker who showed us how large a single would be) and a side of garlic knots.  We stood in the small shop as I watched the baker place the slices of ham, green bell peppers, and cheese onto the fresh dough.  \n\nOur garlic knots came first and the staff carried them outside to our table.  For some reason, we only got 4 instead of 6 pieces, but my friend and I didn't complain because I would give these knots 3/5 stars. It was very ordinary; just a slight taste of garlic on top and the rest of the knot was like any piece of toasted bread.  The marinara sauce also did not excite my taste buds any more than the ones from Little Caesar's would.\n\nThe staff brought out the Stromboli next and I already thought it was a large portion, but then he came back to bring out the other half!  I used a knife and fork to cut through the crispy, golden brown dough, but it is definitely not so oily that you can't use your hands.

Once its folded, oil from the cheese starts dripping out of the bottom, either onto the plate or my shirt. \n\n- Bubbling hot cheese: So hot that it often burns the roof of my mouth and most of the time my mouth is half-open huffing and puffing trying to cool it down. \n\n- Tons of cheese:  This is usually evident when taking a slice from the pie. The cheese just overflows over the edges and no matter how many times I loop the cheese back onto the slice, it keeps overflowing till it eventually cools down to a more solid and manageable consistency.\n\n- Tasty crust:  Connoisseurs say it's the coal burning ovens or water, similar to how SF sourdough is unique because of the SF water.  Some out-of-state NYC style pizzerias have water transported from NYC for authenticity sake.  But I'm not sure if this place does that or if it even makes a difference.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind I went here with mild expectations. From the outside it looks like any other small pizza restaurant, in fact I drove past it the first time and had to make a loop.  The parking is a little tight as there seems to be only 4 spaces in front.  \n\nBut once you step inside, the ambiance screams NYC.  There are vintage shots of infamous NYC architecture, pictures of the NYC skyline, street signs, subway signs, maps, and straps.  I wish the straps were a little lower so I could've hanged on while waiting for my pizza and reminisce back when I rode the subway during rush hour. \n\nThe service was great,  I had initially ordered a large cheese pizza ($18) from an employee there, but when the owner showed up a few minutes later he walked up to me and asked if I was taken care of.  He than proceeded to do the same to other patrons waiting for their pizza.\n\nThe crust was very good, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The cheese was very tasty as well, I believe they use Grande cheese as there's a Grande sticker on the box.  \n\nSo does it remind me of NYC pizza?  Not exactly but it is a tasty thin crust pizza and probably one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had outside of NYC.

New York's pizza still stands head and shoulder's above SONY's. \n\nI DESPERATELY wanted to come here and LOVE the place. Having worked in Manhattan for ten years I clearly know what is truly the pizza mecca of the universe. John's down on Bleecker is my personal pizza temple. Every year when the family returns to NYC in September, we must make this a stop on the way ... right up there with having to catch a game up at the Stadium ... an evening match or two out in Flushing at the U.S. Open ... grabbing a 'recession special' at Gray's Papaya near the Village ... a Reuben at Stage Deli on 6th with cole slaw / potato salad / a garlic pickle or three ... Steak Fromage with a side of creamed spinach at Spark's ... you New Yawkahs (current and former) know the drill ... \n\nGrowing up just east of New Haven, we also were lucky to have two thin crust establishments in Sally's and Pepe's on Wooster Street that had their own claims to thin crust pizza fame, as well ... or at least any Yalie you spoke with. Pepe's White Clam Pizza is truly to die for ... but at times their wood-fired brick ovens get the best of them and their crust, while thin, can also very much resemble charcoal. John's wins hands down here ... every time. \n\nSo I enter this thin crust palace with such freakin' high hopes a little after 1:30 PM today ... I order me up a slice of just plain cheese and a slice of mushroom and sausage, along with a can of A&W Creme Soda. \n\nI order the plain cheese specifically to have it as the baseline to measure all others against ... too many toppings on a slice can distract you from the basic foundations of a great pie ... crust / sauce / cheese. \n\nA few minutes in the oven and they're on two paper plates supported by a pizza pie pan (nice touch, Mr. Cashier ... very nice touch ... thanks!) and I'm out the door to the take a seat at one of the 3-4 tables out on the sidewalk. \n\nMy first bite into the cheese slice was .......... ARRRRGGGGHHHHHH ... not the transcendental experience I was desperately yearning for ... YES, better than anything I've had here in ten years, but not an epiphany, not the orgasmic realization of finding something so necessary to the soul as a great slice of thin crust pie from New York City. Bite after bite reinforced my initial impressions. \n\nThe crust, while requisitely thin and crisp, lacked the right ... how do I say it ... flavor, I guess. Maybe it IS the goddamn tap water in the city that makes it so uniquely delicious ... what the hell do I know? The sauce was just OK. The cheese was just OK. \n\nYou know how I know this is just an OK pie? ... albeit under excruciatingly high standards such as mine? ... I didn't finish the crusts before I started the second slice ..... the true yardstick in my book. I've never done that at John's ... every last bite of crust is consumed before charging into the next slice ... it's that good all by itself ... unadorned by anything. \n\nThe second slice was not what I ordered ... it was only mushroom ... tiny, sliver-thin slices of the fungi adorned the slice ... it clearly could have used the sausage as originally ordered to kick up the mojo ... my bad for not checking before they went into the oven, I guess. My same observations apply here as well. \n\nThe ambiance is nice, but not great. Terrific photos and posters ... most of them, iconic images of my home away from home, but the seating outside on the walk wasn't helped by the fact that they cryptically have painted 4 spots on the sidewalk itself off the road just outside the entrance and in front of the tables. As I was finishing my last slice a huge Dodge Ram Cummins Diesel pick up decides to park up on the sidewalk about three feet away from me ... so much for that dining experience ... diesel fumes choking out the last few minutes of the meal ... \n\nbut, alas, \n\nsadly, \n\nthis was probably the one element of the experience that was closest to grabbing a legit slice of pie on the run in NYC.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 3}, {"index": 1483, "review": "I've never tried the pizza in NYC, but I would imagine that this is IT.

The punishment for partaking in the yummy goodness during the pizza-fast is the eating of an entire sheet of Dryer Lint.

It has pesto, marinated chicken and mushrooms that all have oil and water.  Even a short time in a box, the water will go right down the cracks and hit the bottom.  There is an easy solution to this...a nice hot oven.  If you have a pizza stone, it is best.  Heat the over to about 450 or 475.  Let it get nice and hot.  If you don't have a pizza stone, a cookie sheet will work.  Make sure the cookie sheet stays in the over to get nice and hot.  Then, when you get home, just drop the slices you are going eat on the cookie sheet or a minute or two.  The moisture will cook right off and the crust will become dry and firm again.  Also, the crust on our \"to go\" pies is a bit thicker so it holds up better in a box.\n\nI would suggest, as you do, that you try just a plain slice.

When I asked if he'd heard of Yelp before, he said he had because of the business and immediately put the window cling in the front window.\n\nThe place is a really nice hole in the wall between the surplus store and J&J's Blues Club on Stevens Creek, and it's decorated with anything and everything you can think of from New York.

Choices that were available when we arrived were pretty standard:\n\ncheese\npepperoni\npepperoni and mushroom\npepperoni and sausage\nsausage and mushroom\nSicilian-style cheese Pizza\n\nSlices are $3.50 each. If you go for lunch between 11am-2pm, you get a free soda (bottle or can) with every two slices you buy, which is a pretty good deal. Whole pies start at $14 for small and $18 for regular. \n\nThere's not really anywhere to sit, so take out is the best option. We got four NY slices (one of each except the sausage and mushroom), the Sicilian, and a cannoli and brought them over to a friend's house to eat. \n\nThe pizza too put it mildly, is incredible. There's a perfect combination of sauce, cheese and toppings...not too much of anything and it melds into a perfect slice that's easy to fold and eat. The cannolis are good too, crispy sweet dough filled with a creamy chocolate-chip filling.\n\nEverything was so good that 5 hours later, we went back to pick up dinner. They had a steak and green pepper pizza at that time and that was good too, but my favorites were the pepperoni and sausage and pepperoni and mushroom.

We headed down anyway only to find a sign on their door stating that they were going to be closed day and night.  Sad, but we figured oh well, worst things could happen.  We headed home and cooked some food, then crashed out.   The next morning I get 2 calls from a number I didn't recognize.  Turns it was from the shop apologizing that they hadn't updated their message and they saw that I had called last night.  I was shocked.  I'd never seen a business care so much!  Folks, this is the place to go!\n\nUpdate - Mid October, 2009\n\nHadn't been in a while but I was dying for some pizza and decided it was time to visit the Mecca of East Coast pizza on the West Coast.  I brought a friend with me and introduced her to the owner, the nicest guy ever.   Even though it'd been almost a year and a half since I'd been in there he still remembered me, my name and what I did for work!  I got the sausage pizza (it's the best) and my friend got the cheese.  She normally hates sausage on pizza and won't even dare to try it.  Despite her best efforts to resist, I managed to convince her to try it out.  She loved it and ended up stealing several bites of mine, so many bites that I had to get a second slice.   Before we left the owner gave my friend and I two free slices of Hawaiian for the road!  \n\nThe owner is such a hardworking, chivalrous, and down to earth guy that it makes me happy to see his place doing so well.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 5}, {"index": 1788, "review": "Parking sucks!

The place was tiny with a few counter seats inside and three small folding plastic tables in the walkway/parking lot area.  \n\nI ordered a slice of pepperoni/mushroom and my husband got a slice of sausage/jalapeno.  I had a bite of his slice and it was tangy and spicy from the pickled jalapeno.  We both agreed that the pizza was a little overcooked (cheese was too brown and a little dry and hard on top).   It had potential though.  Then we tried my slice...OMG!  For a minute, I thought I was back on the east coast!  We both absolutely could not stop talking about how good this slice was as we took each bite.  The grease from the pepperoni made the cheese extra flavorful.  The cheese was also deliciously hot, soft, chewy, and pulling with every bite the way pizza cheese should pull when it is perfectly cooked.  The crust was thin and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Perfection.

Even Regina Pizzeria in Boston, which I consider to be expensive (but is THE best pizza I've ever had) charges less than $20 for a large specialty pie.

In this part of the country Pizza is like a religion, and of course New York style is the only style (sorry, all you Chicago people).  It wasn't uncommon to get a slice after school as a snack.  Suffice it to say, I ate a lot of pizza growing up.  \n\nThings that are important (to me) in a pizza:  The crust has to be thin, but not to thin.  Bottom of the crust should be a little crispy.  The cheese (which must only be Mozzarella, not some blend) has to have the right flavor, the sauce needs to be good, quality toppings, and it all needs to be in the right proportion.  Fortunately, for all of us transplants (and everyone else) in the south bay, Kirk opened A Slice of New York.\n\nI first found Slice of NY when I was Christmas shopping in 2006.  I was heading to Steven's Creek Surplus (located right next store as a reference) and I was intrigued by what was a storefront pizza shop similar to St. Mark's Pizza in NYC and all the places back home.  I had dinner plans with my wife so I didn't eat anything, even though I wanted to.  I went back the next day, and was so happy I did.  The Pizza has the right proportion of crust, to cheese, to sauce, to toppings (very important) and the taste is spot on New York Pizza.\n\nUnlike most other pizza places around, they also have Sicilian Pizza, a staple at pizzeria's back home.  Sometimes nothing is better than a thick doughy slice of Sicilian.  Once again, sorry Chicago, this is what deep dish should be.\n\nThey also make the best Calzones I have had in California.  Good Ricotta and Mozzarella cheese, good fillings which you pick (Calzones are not just a little of every possible filling), sauce on the side, and baked to perfection.\n\nI would give this place extra stars for the owner, Kirk, because he is very concerned with customer service, and for the huge New York Rangers poster on the back wall, but I used all five up on the food.\n\nOne of only four place I eat pizza in the south bay, and definitely at the top of the list.

I had to put in my two cents after my hubby's review below.\n\nI'm a NY'er living here in the South Bay for two years.  When we go back east to visit family getting pizza (and bagels) is top priority.  I think it ranks higher than visiting mom.    I'm also a SUCKER for any place that calls itself \"New York Pizza.\"  I can't believe I've gone this long without trying it.  \n\nAs mentioned below we got a large pie with mushrooms, fresh garlic and half sausage.  I can only vouch for the meatless side and have to say that it was by far the closest thing I've had to NY pizza since being here.  It tasted like real crust, cheese and sauce unlike the processed stuff everything else around here seems to taste like.  BUT, it did lack a little flavor and grease.  Almost a little bit card-boardy.  I think it has to do with the water...  I know greasy food is NOT popular here, but my favorite part of the pizza is after you've got nothing left but crust you open it up and bite into the crease where the grease has been seeping out onto your plate.  I opened my crust only to find nothing.  \n\nAnd I thought the garlic knots were GREAT.  Chewy, doughy, greasy and garlicy.  Just the way they should be.  I dipped my crust in the extra oil the knots left behind in the foil and all was good.     \n\nI told my husband that I think we should open a bagel shop next door.

I had ordered a large Rockefeller Center: pepperoni, Italian sausage, salami, meatballs, and chopped garlic. The toppings were generous and covered the entire face of the pizza.

I know a lot of people like cold pizza, my SLF being one of them but I usually like my pizza hot. Amazingly enough, their pizza actually tasted great even cold as I had to have a late night snack. The crust held up well, not getting soggy or tasting like cardboard.

As a bonus they have some very tasty sicilian pizza as well as garlic knots.

It amuses me to hear the opinions of so-called \"real New Yorkers\" pontificating about what \"real N.Y. pizza\" is like.   I grew up on the border of Queens and Brooklyn in a neighborhood called Ridgewood.  At that time there was a pizzeria on virtually every block on Myrtle Avenue, the local main drag.  I hate to burst the nitrous oxide bubble here, but this is NOT \"exactly like\" real N.Y. pizza.  As far as pizza that you can get in the South Bay, this may well be the best that you can get, but that does not make it just like the real thing.  It LOOKS just like it.  Obviously the owners spent some time in New York.  Sal's pizza in Campbell also LOOKS just like it.  But there is one critical difference.  \n\nNew York pizza is composed of three things:  crust, sauce and cheese.  If the primary three elements are there, then it should be SO GOOD that you don't need ANY toppings on it, and in fact 75% of the slices served in N.Y. are of simple cheese pizza.   The main problem with almost all \"New York style\" pizza outside of a radius of about 200 miles from Manhattan (I have also found the real thing in Connecticut, Boston and Pennsylvania)  is that the crust is never quite right.    The consistency of the crust should be bubbly and  \"layered\" or \"flakey\" in a way that is not easy to describe and even harder to duplicate, and, sorry to say, they just miss the mark here.  On the plus side, the crust at ASONY was \"foldable,\" which means soft enough not to crack when folded lengthwise.   (And native New Yorkers always fold the slice lengthwise, pick it up and hold it with one hand, never hold it flat with two hands and would never be caught dead using a knife and fork.)  If a pizza crust is so crispy that it cracks when folded, it usually means it's been heated too long and is no longer what I would call \"New York pizza.\"  \n\nThe second problem is that the mozarella that they use here was also not quite right although it was applied correctly and in the right amount.  The thin sauce that they use is right on the mark, however.  \n\nTwo other minor observations that make me suspicious of the pedigree here:  (1) No anchovies among the list of toppings (unheard of in New York).  (2) A sub is called a \"hero\" in New York, not a sub.  \n\nAgain, ASONY is probably head and shoulders above its competition locally.  I am not saying it's bad at all.  But don't give me this \"exactly like...\" business.  The closest approximation to the real thing I have found in the Bay Area was at Marcello's (four stars), on Castro St, at Market, in San Francisco (that's right, the infamous gay ghetto), where they make a crust a good notch above the ones I have tried at ASONY.   \n\nHowever, if you want to check out a place that I would give a five-star rating, I think you have to save a little money, get on a plane and go to a place like this:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/rosas-pizza-ridgewood#hrid:9D_Nfbnb__YMWAR3j1NEEQ", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 3}, {"index": 2262, "review": "good new york style thin crust pizza. very flavorful and tasty.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 4}, {"index": 2263, "review": "i liked it, but it didn't have the same crispy-ness that i had inhaled in new york city.", "name": "A Slice of New York", "rating": 3}, {"index": 2264, "review": "Took me six months after learning about this place to finally try it out.

I'm constantly searching for the elusive holy grail of pizza in the Valley of pizza death. This place is at least on my radar. I've eaten here a number of times and it's certainly good and better than most of the craptastic pies I find around. However, there's something missing, it can be rather soulless. The crust is spot on, but it could use a little more salt in the dough mix maybe, or maybe it really is all in the water. The sauce is good but it seems they need to add a bit more, NYC pies aren't drowning in sauce but I've had a few that were a bit of a sauceless desert wasteland. The pies are good but they seem to need a better cheese since they can be a little bland, maybe I just got an off one. The toppings are good but I have to say I don't like the way the sausage as it's all crumbled up tiny instead of in nice chunks. I'd also rather have some mushrooms that weren't shredded up and sliced a bit thicker. The prices are ok since you get a nice 18\" pie with big slices instead of the 1/4 inch slices so many places out here seem to cut their pies into. The garlic knots are awesome and are as big as baby's head..well ok a really small baby or a cat maybe....you get the point, they're big. I like most of the pies but for some reason I think they do a plain pepperoni best.

My bf and I came here for a late lunch so the place wasn't crowded at all, which was a good thing because we were able to sit at the counter area inside instead of being stuck outside practically on the streets! The counter only fits about 5 people though.  We ended up ordering a slice of the Sicilian square (bacon, pepperoni, sausage, ham, and all types of other meats, basically a meat lovers pizza) and another slice (not sure of the name) that had pesto, chicken, mushroom and garlic!  We also had a half order of the garlic knots (3 pieces).  The meal itself was pretty cheap...we only ended up spending about $11 for our entire meal. Well worth the price because all three were soooo yummy. The Sicilian was a bit overwhelming for me though because there was a ton of meat on it :P And the other slice was just amazing! I loved the garlic chunks!  The knots were very tastey too. You can definitely taste the garlic oil! They were a bit oily but nonetheless delicious!
